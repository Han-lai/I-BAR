## I-BAR,the AI Bartender

###### You know that thing  When you walk into a bar full of mystery, the bartender asks you what you'd like to haveâ€”not in terms of a specific cocktail, or even the base spirit, but in terms of the flavor profile? And then just sets to work grabbing one bottle after another until before you know it you've got a little bit of magic in your mouth and you don't even know how? As far as I'm concerned.That's "I-BAR" experience.
###### The final goal of this project is to allow user to understand the base spirit,materials,preparation steps,etc..,so that users can learn how to create their own favorite cocktails in this project.
