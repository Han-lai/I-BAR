The most credible version attributes the cocktail to Joe Sheridan, the head chef of the restaurant at the Foynes Flying Boat terminal in County Limerick in the early 1940s. Legend has it that when he first served it and was asked if it was Brazilian coffee, Sheridan cheekily replied that it was “Irish coffee.”', 'The drink was later made famous by Staton Deplante, who worked at the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco during the 1950s.

Vya makes an interesting Negroni from mid-November through New Years, but just tastes 'out of season' the rest of the year. Punt e Mes is too much of a good thing and kills the brightness of the gin. And speaking of, Bombay Sapphire is my go-to gin here, as I prefer to save the Aviation for a dry Martini. More exotic gins seem lost here, and Tanqueray is for Tonics.

I would say it started appearing on bar menus 10-15 years ago, with mixed reviews.

After rimming the glass, add lots of ice, then your worcestershire & tabasco, before the vodka and Clamato juice.\n-Try using a higher ratio of Worcestershire to tabasco than the 1:1 in this recipe. I usually do 4:1, unless the guest requests it to be mild. I prefer my Caesar to be “muddy” (extra Worcestershire) and spicy.
