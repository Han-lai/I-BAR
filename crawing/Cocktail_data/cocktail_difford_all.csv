I was waiting for 5 p.m., the time scheduled for my first interview for a job as a barlady. ¡§I had always wanted to do this: to play with ingredients, come up with unexpected combinations, see a customer¡¦s smile as they taste something that you have created for the first time¡K At that point I was hoping to find a mentor who would teach me to become the best. ¡§Suddenly a friendly voice interrupted my thoughts: ¡§May I, miss?¡¨. I looked up and saw a guy smiling at me. He had a camera in his hand. He was very handsome. He took a photo of me and then tried to make conversation. ¡§I was a bit too nervous to talk, but the guy was stylish and kind. And openness towards other people is one of the most important qualities of being a barlady, so I smiled at him and began to chat. ¡§He told me that he was a freelance photographer and that it was his last day in Rome; I told him about my passion and about the interview that I was about to have. His face lit up and he made me a promise: if I got the job, I had to go back to that square and we would celebrate together. I accepted, more out of politeness than anything else. By then, it was almost 5 p.m., so I said goodbye and left. ¡§The interview was a big success. The bar manager told me that he could see the same passion in me that he had had at my age: it was the greatest compliment that he could make. When I left, I was so happy that I decided to keep my promise and I went back to the square. He was there waiting for me, playing around with his camera. ¡§We spent the whole night together, confiding in each other and walking through deserted, beautiful Rome. I found out that during his week in Rome, he had never tried my two favourite dishes, artichokes ¡¥alla giudea¡¦ and focaccia with wild rosemary, so I took him to a restaurant in the hills. ¡§I personally considered this meeting as a sign of fate: if I hadn¡¦t been kind to that guy, things would not have gone so well. Saying goodbye the next morning was bittersweet. We decided not to exchange contact details to preserve the magic of that night: if fate wanted us to meet again, then it would happen somehow. Months later, on a train journey, I found a glossy magazine on the seat. I was idly flipping through it, when I came across a story about Rome. It was entitled: ¡§How A Dreamy Girl Helped Me To Become A Lucky Roman Americano¡¨. Guess who it was referring to? The photo credits were printed at the end of the article, along with an e-mail address.¡¨"	null

"By Thalita Alves, Australia  ¡§There¡¦s only one thing I adore almost as much as mixing beautiful drinks: dancing. Imagining original combinations of ingredients for a cocktail isn¡¦t so different from developing a sequence of steps in a well-structured choreography. ¡§Right foot forward, left foot sweeps in a semi-circle, right foot forward, left foot raised. I still remember how the first choreography I worked on started. I repeated it hundreds of times in front of the mirror, striving for perfect coordination with the other girls. Don¡¦t go imagining the corps de ballet at La Scala: we were just an amateur dance company, but we were full of passion and determination. ¡§But choreographies also need a good story, research, inspiration that comes from somewhere. That was always my favourite part of the entire dance creation process: to choose the message, the idea to be translated into motion. I found a muse that inspired me in piecing together a short act: Anita Garibaldi, the greatest Brazilian heroine, a wonderful mix of romance and strength. That would have been amazing to dance and to watch. ¡§But I never finished my final work. While working on Anita, I discovered a new Thalita. As a girl who had never gone very far from home, I discovered I had a big dream and a life-long passion to do and see more. I felt an inexplicable need to seek out new places and suddenly I found myself in an airport for the very first time. I caught a plane to Australia: an unknown country where I had no friends or family, didn¡¦t speak the language and had no career. But I knew that this place would be my home. ¡§I put my creativity to one side for almost 5 years, too busy building my new life. Having gone from job to job, one day I ended up in a cocktail bar. While mixing my first drink I felt that spark from my dancing days again, putting different things together to create a whole new something. My passion was back, albeit in a new shape. ¡§When I realised I could finally tell stories again, this time in liquid form, I started working on my favourite one: that of Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi, who fell in love with Anita, a person of strength and resilience but at the same time also extremely tender and charming. Anita was reborn, as a cocktail. ¡§I decided to narrate that intercontinental love story through the most emblematic spirits and flavours of the two worlds: Campari and fresh and juicy blood oranges symbolising Italy, Sagatiba Velha and bright green limes for Brazil. I sealed this union with a macadamia nut orgeat to celebrate the country I now call home: Australia. Anita, this symbolic mix of 2 worlds, is garnished with fragrant and aromatic basil leaves to finish. ""This cocktail, like the heroine whose name it bears, has become an icon of something much bigger to me: Australia itself, and all the people that have mixed together over the centuries and moved to this beautiful country to build brand new lives here and, ultimately, make it what it is.¡¨"	null

"By Jennyfer Lee and Jorge Cordero, Dominican Republic  JENNYFER ¡§You can¡¦t imagine how many bizarre characters there are in the world until you open a bar in the Dominican Republic. Day after day, night after night, that bar became the meeting point of the most surprising people you can conceive of. American businessmen fleeing financial crashes, bored children of even more bored billionaires, hidden treasure hunters, coffee industrialists, snake breeders, thieves and artists.¡¨ JORGE ¡§Foremost among them, both chronologically and in terms of weirdness, was Tico: he set foot in our bar before the paint had even dried on the walls. He was tall, as thin as a rake and dressed in a spotlessly clean white suit that had seen better days. He was always clutching the handle of a battered briefcase that he never let out of his sight. For months, the only two words that we heard him say were ¡§Negroni, thanks¡¨.¡¨ JENNYFER ¡§He came every evening at the same time. The same white suit, same table, same Negroni and above all the same briefcase. We watched him discreetly from behind the bar, trying to find out more about him.¡¨ JORGE ¡§There were stickers and stitches on that case that told a long story of travels around the world. We were dying with curiosity to learn about his adventures, like every true bartender, but we would never have asked him directly, like every true bartender.¡¨ JENNYFER ¡§By this point, Tico was a silent celebrity in our bar: other customers came up with fantastic hypotheses about him. Some people tried to make conversation with him, but received only polite smiles in return. Then one day Tico arrived before his usual time: it was sundown and the place was still empty.¡¨ JORGE ¡§Instead of sitting at his usual table, which we had begun to reserve for him, Tico came up to the bar. He told us that he would be leaving tomorrow and that he would not return, then he laid his briefcase before him, opened it and began to tell us his story.¡¨ JENNYFER ¡§We have never revealed the contents of that briefcase to anyone and we won¡¦t do today: what you say in the bar, stays in the bar. We can only say that it was full of stories: Italy, where Tico found and lost his great love; the Silk Road, where the mandarin in his pocket saved his life; the Humboldt Current and the night when, off the coast of South America, Tico traded a bottle of tequila for his freedom; the Chilean pink pepper plantation that first made him rich and then forced him to flee; the trade winds that propelled his boat to the African coast, when he only had coffee left on board. Those and many other stories filled his briefcase.¡¨ JORGE ¡§If you want to know something more about Tico¡¦s life, you have two choices: go to the best bar in your area and look for a silent man dressed in white drinking Negroni. Or come to us and order the cocktail that we have dedicated to him, named ¡¥Around The World with a Negroni¡¦.¡¨"	null

"When made to Lucas Bols original specification: 1 shot Bols Genever, 1 shot Bols Butterscotch liqueur and ? shot sweet vermouth, this drink has a great flavour but lacks balls (or perhaps I should say Bols). Hence the formula above which is heavy on the Genever with equal parts butterscotch liqueur and sweet vermouth. It's even better when an oude genever is used rather than a jonge as this amplifies the butterscotch notes. Beware, Bols' original recipe calls for a lemon zest twist garnish but the lemon oils overpower the butterscotch, so if you use a slither of lemon skin to fix our choice of a Werther's Original to the rim, then don't express the lemon's oils over the drink. Don't be tempted to use buttercup flowers as a garnish as they are poisonous. They are also poisonous when eaten by livestock but their acrid taste and the blistering of the mouth they cause mean that animals don't tend to eat them. Interestingly, the toxins degrade when dried, so hay containing dried buttercups is safe for animals to eat."	null

"By Bettina Kupsa, Germany  ¡§In my opinion, Hamburg is the most beautiful city in the world. If I didn¡¦t live here, the only other place where I would feel comfortable is the moon: I would spend one day on the light side and the next day on the dark side. I like living this way, on the border between opposites. Jumping from sweet to bitter, from day to night. ¡§This is why Hamburg is the perfect city: here, opposites continually collide. This is exactly what I wanted for my bar. An elegant cocktail bar in the middle of the Red Light District, a beautiful contrast. I wanted to be surrounded by customers who resemble me, enlivened by opposites. Now every evening when I look around, I see ties and tattoos, managers and philosophers, angels and devils kissing each other against the wall. ¡§The streets of Hamburg offer magical encounters that can change your life in seconds. Like what happened recently, on the night before Christmas eve. At 5 in the afternoon, while I was raising the shutter at the front of my bar, I saw these two young musicians playing on the corner of the street. In spite of the freezing cold, they were dressed in thin layers and seemed very relaxed. She sang with a sugar-sweet voice and beat out the rhythm on a drum that had seen better days. He accompanied her on the guitar. ¡§The song had a slow, captivating rhythm ¡V there was something South American about it. Unfortunately, I didn¡¦t understand the words, but I was completely captivated by its melancholy sound: hearing that music was like reflecting about the past while walking barefoot on grass. I imagined the smell of an extinguished bonfire, the morning after a wild beach party. ¡§When I got to my bar, it occurred to me that they should play there. I wanted my customers to experience what I had felt listening to their music. I made two cups of tea, but when I went back out to invite them in, there was nobody there. The music stayed in my head and my hands began to whirl into action, even though there was no longer anything to listen to. I grabbed a shaker and started to mix ingredients that would recreate that bittersweet harmony in my head. ¡§It took a while and I had to work with all five senses. I began with Campari and blended it with Cherry & Tonka Infused Tequila, followed by lemon and sugar, adding Orange Foam as the final touch. I haven¡¦t seen those two musicians since, but if I ever do, I will definitely make them Chepari, the cocktail that they inspired.¡¨"	null

"It's is possible, indeed probable, that the original Pimm's Cup served in the eponymous London bar was in fact based on old tom gin rather than London dry gin.

"Arguably, when numbering my fruit cups, I left the best till last. (I skipped number 16 because the number 7 so befits a Tennessee whiskey-based cocktail). If using a 40% alc./vol. Tennessee whiskey such as standard Jack Daniel's No.7 (as opposed to one of the brand's higher alc./vol. special bottlings) then it benefits from an extra splash (?oz/7.5ml) as in this recipe.

We¡¦d probably spend the whole time arguing about how to do things but it would still be the best holiday of our lives.¡¨ JAN ¡§That¡¦s how things have always worked between us: we are so different that the chemistry we have is perfect. She is very open and friendly, I am the thinker who comes up with unexpected solutions. For example, I worked in the fashion business for twenty years and had one of the nicest shops in the city. Then, one morning, I suddenly felt that that world was no longer a part of me. I sold everything practically overnight and left on a long round-the-world trip.I wanted to rediscover my best qualities, my creativity, my curiosity, the part of me obsessed by details. I found it in a little bar in the south of France watching a bartender at work. It was a brief moment but straight after I was sure: that would be my new life.I returned home and almost immediately opened the bar.¡¨ HANNAH ¡§When my father gets an idea in his head nobody can change his mind, all you can do is give him a hand. That¡¦s why I decided that I would also work in the bar for a while.?I thought: just long enough to get things in order... but I¡¦m still here. The truth is that I was also seduced by mixology but for different reasons to those of my father: I like to amaze people, making them feel good, creating an atmosphere they¡¦ll never forget. When we think up a new cocktail we always start at the end: we try to envisage someone drinking it. Who are they? Where are they? What are they doing?¡¨ JAN ¡§For example, when creating l¡¦?t? Anis? we imagined three Milan girls relaxing after a day of shopping in the summer. They go into a bar, enjoying the shade and the cool. There is some old-fashioned music playing, you can also hear the rustling of the vinyl. They put their elegant shopping bags on the floor, sit round a table and order our cocktail. Something fresh, classical and contemporary at the same time, undeniably classy.Campari, Sour Orange that seems to be orange but tastes of lemon, sugar syrup, Rinquinquin, Absinthe and a splash of tonic.This is what I meant when I said that my daughter and I are very different but when we work together it is Boom: magic happens.¡¨ HANNAH ¡§Just like in a great cocktail.¡¨"	null

"By Julie Reiner, USA ""It has been years since I left Hawaii but every time I return home my feelings are bittersweet. Not just because of the beauty of the place or my childhood memories but for what happened to me the night before I left. ""I was sitting on the terrace at home, breathing in the scent of the hibiscus. Suddenly I saw a strange figure on the rocks, illuminated by the light of the full moon: it was a man I had never seen before. He appeared to be fishing but when he cast his net into the ocean it had a strange glow to it, a kind of coloured rainbow. ""I left the house and, barefooted, walked the few dozen metres that separate my home from the sea, heading towards the man. He was battling with something that must have been enormous: his back was almost completely curved and his tense muscles revealed a superhuman strength. ""After a few seconds I realised that, centimetre by centimetre, the man was pulling an entire island out of the ocean. I watched the palm trees emerge from the water and I started to hear the songs of the birds hiding in the vegetation. ""When the island was completely out of the water the man, worn out, collapsed on the sand and fell asleep. Walking on my tiptoes so as not to wake him, I got into the water and swam to the Eden he had just fished out. I walked among the plants and flowers, I sat on the beach and I picked all types of fruit growing among the vegetation. I felt at peace like never before and, in that triumph of colours and fragrances, I fell asleep. ""When I opened my eyes I was in bed, at home. For a moment I thought it had all been a dream but then I realised that I was holding a fragrant red strawberry in my hand. I ran to the window but the sea in front of me was as calm as ever, as far as the eye could see. ""At that moment I realised that that night, a mixture of dreams and reality, was my island's and my childhood's way of saying goodbye to me. For me that strawberry, still in my hand, was a precious gift. ""I have never forgotten that night and years later, when I began working as a bartender, that strawberry was the inspiration behind my masterpiece, the KULA NEGRONI."""	null

"By Nagore Arregui, Spain  ¡§If you want to get my attention, you can choose between two infallible methods: make me laugh or challenge me. This story involves both these things. ¡§It was around 6 p.m. and I was checking my e-mails on my mobile, sipping a Negroni. Spam, an invitation to a friend¡¦s birthday, my mother asking how I was, more spam¡K and there it was. The subject was ¡§Miss Arregui, we¡¦d love to smile to you. ¡§It was a link to access a secret community signed with the logo of Red Quintessence, a legendary organization that I had heard people talk about, but did not believe really existed. You can¡¦t apply for membership: if you are the right person, they will find you. The members all have one thing in common: knowledge of the most hidden human secret, laughter. ¡§Warning: we are not talking about jokes or television catchphrases. The Red Quintessence studies a primordial reflex as old as mankind, the purest distillate of endorphins, a weapon with devastating power that saves lives and destroys civilizations. Why had I been deemed worthy of that time-honoured circle? I swear that I don¡¦t know. For me, laughing is the most natural thing in life ¡V my customers say that I am made of 70% water and 30% humour. Perhaps an envoy from the Red Quintessence came to my bar one night. ¡§When I got home, I saw that I had received two authentication passwords: ¡§PRAWNS¡¨ and ¡§ARTICHOKES¡¨. I opened my profile and saw that it had already been completed: my story, what I like, what I do¡K in some ways it was unsettling, but then again I supposed that the Red Quintessence would have to know someone intimately before judging them to be suitable. ¡§I looked through other members of the network and found famous people alongside ordinary people, men and women of all colours and backgrounds working together to save the world through laughter. This is not hyperbole: as I went on, I discovered that over the centuries the Red Quintessence has avoided world wars by suggesting the right joke during negotiations. Or it has started the revolution that toppled a dictator with the timely distribution of a satirical cartoon. ¡§I continued reading throughout the night and in the morning I decided that I too would play my part. I wanted to become a guerrilla fighter on behalf of smiling and I began in my favourite place: my bar. The next evening, a new speciality appeared on my bar¡¦s menu, the Quintessenza, to be served strictly with a big smile.¡¨"	null
