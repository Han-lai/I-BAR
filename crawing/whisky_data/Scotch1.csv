Master Blender Dr. Rachel Barrie has crafted The GlenDronach Traditionally Peated from a marriage of the finest Pedro Ximénez, Oloroso sherry and port casks, using the same principles laid down almost two hundred years ago.Interwoven with robust Highland character, The GlenDronach Traditionally Peated is peated to those same traditional levels and has all of the richly-sherried, fullbodied character of The GlenDronach.Master Blender, Dr. Rachel Barrie said: “The GlenDronach Traditionally Peated offers connoisseurs a rare opportunity to explore the distillery’s rich depths of sherry cask maturation, whilst paying homage to the robust peat-smoked earthy character of the early 19th century, that James Allardice himself would likely have enjoyed.

"The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 8 (61%, OB, 2019)", GlenDronach distillery,https://thewhiskyphiles.com/2019/12/11/the-glendronach-cask-strength-batch-8/, null,Scotch, 61%,https://thewhiskyphiles.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/gd-batch-8-infront.jpg,"The GlenDronach distillery is pleased to announce the eighth release of its Cask Strength Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky, matured for ten years in Pedro Ximénez and Oloroso sherry casks from Andalucía. This expression offers connoisseurs a deeper insight into the distillery’s signature profile, by bottling the whisky at its natural strength of 61%, to bring the full depth of maturation in Spanish oak casks.With each unique cask strength release, Master Blender Dr. Rachel Barrie selects the perfect marriage of sherry casks before bottling at cask strength and without chill filtration, as was the custom when The GlenDronach distillery was established in 1826. As with all of The GlenDronach expressions, the rich natural colour is drawn from the Spanish oak in which it rests.Master Blender, Dr. Rachel Barrie said:“The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 8 is incredibly rich and full-bodied, the result of years of slow maturation in Pedro Ximénez puncheons, quarter casks and Oloroso sherry butts. Casks were individually selected, combined and bottled at natural cask strength to deliver maximum character and depth. Sip layers of sherry cask matured character unfolding slowly over time; from mocha, dark chocolate and caramel espresso to cherry cake layered with sultana and plum; the depth of character is boundless. The texture is like sipping velvet with a burst of sumptuous fruits, warm spices and intense dark chocolate which crescendos into The GlenDronach’s signature long and richly satisfying finish. I hope the most discerning palates will sip, savour and appreciate the full-bodied character of Cask Strength Batch 8.”Official tasting notes:Appearance: Deep tawny gold.Nose: Sandalwood, oak balsam and rich aromatic columbian coffee with dark manuka honey, cocoa and brazil nut.Palate: Like sipping velvet with mocha, caramel macchiato and cherry chocolate cake, layered with dates, plum skin and sultana.Finish: Savour the exceedingly long finish of espresso coffee and cocoa with traces of liquorice and cherry tobacco","The latest Batch No. 8 of GlenDronach’s cask strength edition, launched in 2019 and coming in at 61% ABV – the highest ABv so far in this range. Perhaps it is because of the high regard of The Glendronach’s core range and superb single cask releases this Cask Strength edition is seemingly overlooked. Compare it to Aberlour’s eponymous A’Bunadh expression and this GlenDronach offers huge ABV and sherry-cask influence at a significantly lower price! Perhaps it is the relative newness – this being only Batch 8 from GlenDronach compared to the 60+ batches of A’Bunadh but represents a great value for money alternative. This is the third I have tried from GlenDronach and all have been equally impressive – this looks to be a range with great continuity of quality.This post was sponsored by The GlenDronach by provision of a sample of this product.Previous editionsThe GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 1 (54.8%) 2012The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 2 (55.2%) 2013The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 3 (54.9%) 2013The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 4 (54.7%) 2014The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 5 (55.3%) 2015The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 6 (56.1%) 2016The GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 7 (57.9%) 2018My tasting notes:Appearance: Dark gold (11/20), quick, medium tears and medium legs.Nose: Sweet, candyfloss, apples, apple pie and cinnamon, new leather, fresh and jammy forest fruits, berries, dates, figs, cocoa powder and coffee.Taste: Full-bodied, warming, spiced dried fruit, apple strudel, spirity, caramel latte, fig jam, date, cherry lips sweeties and dark chocolate.Finish: Long, well-spiced Christmas cake and mixed nuts", £62.95 available from The Whisky Exchange

Just as our stillmen refuse to abandon the traditional crafts of distillation in favour of automation or industrialisation, so farmer William Rose rejects the use of herbicides, pesticides and artificial fertilisers. Crop rotation is key. Our barley must take its turn in a seven year farm cycle that also produces organic cattle, sheep, oats, beans, grass, carrots, market gardening and a megawatt of green electricity.

A touch of marine spice and citrus.Palate: Deliciously creamy with the barley notes very much to the fore.Finish; A hot toddy.MID COUL ORGANIC FARMS, DALCROSS, INVERNESSMid Coul is an organic farm that lies on the south side of the Moray Firth to the east of Inverness.  It has been farmed by the Rose family since 1912 and, as can be imagined, has undergone a number of changes during that time. Originally traditional sheep and arable farmers, the family moved into pig and turkey production in the 1950’s before refocussing on organic management of the land in the 1990’s.A particular speciality is the production of high value organic vegetables such as carrots and parsnips but in recent years, much of the production has shifted again, this time towards growing biomass to supply two anaerobic digestion systems generating renewable energy for national gas and electricity grids.Farmer William Rose has provided Bruichladdich with organic barley since 2003 and was the source of grain for our first ever organic single malt. This was probably a world first, certainly in the modern era, although prior to the Green Revolution (which really only started after the second world war), all farming was organic by nature.Today, Mid Coul is a fascinating, vibrant place. They proudly claim that: “Everyone on the farm is constantly striving to ensure that the land is managed to best advantage economically and environmentally.” Crop rotation is central to the organic regime and a very wide range are grown in addition to malting barley, including the root vegetables, rye, oats, beans, nitrogen-fixing clover and grass.  Sheep are raised and organic cattle fattened for market. There is even a small farm shop that operates on an honesty-box principle when supplies are available. Our barley therefore has to take its place within this complex organic cycle. Seeing it in the field the rich understory that organic methods promotes is immediately apparent.  This is evidently not ideal if the aim is maximum yield, but what if quality, rather than yield, is the primary aim?  The idea is very aligned to our philosophy at Bruichladdich.There is a unexpected atmosphere on the farm as a result – one in which very high technology production methods sit comfortably alongside wild and biodiverse hedgerows and field margins that teem with birds, butterflies and wild flowers. An interesting example of this is a good local population of Corn buntings, farmland birds that used to be abundant but are now scarce. According to the RSPB the UK population of these buntings fell by 89 per cent between 1970 and 2003. This is mainly because modern herbicides and insecticides mean fewer seed and insect food sources are available to them on ‘conventional’ farmland. Their presence on Mid-Coul is indicative of the benefits of organic farming to wildlife.Despite this, the Mid Coul operation feels very 21st century. All the farm tractors are fitted with super-accurate GPS navigation systems which enable them to be self-driven up and down, say, a field of carrots.  The driver does not have to worry about guiding the vehicle, he can concentrate on other tasks such as monitoring the cameras that are linked to weed identification software enabling their mechanical removal. These super-sophisticated systems are backed up by teams of up to 70 seasonal workers who lie out on tractor booms to manually weed the rows.While we were there, the permanent staff of eight, plus a number of contractors, were engaged in cutting and storing silage in immense pits ready to feed the new 2.4 megawatt anaerobic digester that will supply natural gas (methane) to the grid when it is brought on line in around one month’s time. The giant green domes of the new plant sit rather futuristically in the landscape and work rather like the four stomachs of a cow, converting biomass to biogas through the stages of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methogenesis – eventually producing methane.The waste ‘digestate’ from the process is then spread back onto the fields as a nutrient-rich fertilizer.One is left with the impression that if we are to maintain our lifestyles in the long term then it will surely be farms like this that lead the way by really addressing sustainability and minimising the inputs of petrochemical based fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and fungicides.  An idealistic vision, yes, but one that William Rose is determined to deliver in a rational, commercially appropriate way.  And judging from the number of beautiful dragonflies, butterflies and flocks of seed-eating birds to be seen thriving on this rich organic farm, it is a vision that can only be of great benefit to our native wildlife as well as people.","Barley, Organic, Terroir, whilst the first of these terms should be very familiar to most scotch whisky drinkers the other two should at least be impinging upon their consciousness by now! As we know there are only three ingredients used in making whisky; barley, water and yeast. The second two of these can have obvious influence on the process.  Water quality and in particular where the water is sourced form and what potentially delicious (e.g. peat) impurities it may contain will influence whisky flavour. Likewise yeast varietals and how long fermentation lasts as well as the type of vessel; clean stainless steal or natural wooden washbacks full of bacterium such as lactobacilli and natural yeasts may all add to the flavour of the wash and subsequent whisky produced. Barley varietals and the malting, including the use of peat smoke or not have an obvious influence on flavour.  The particular conditions under which they barley is grown – collectively known as ‘terroir’ – this includes organic farming methods as used in this Bruichladdich expression, also has an influence on the flavour and yield as it impacts upon the protein and starch ratio’s obtained in the resulting cereal grains. The barley used in this expression was grown at Mid Coul Organic Farm near Inverness and will have been processed and distilled in isolation so as not to be mixed with other distillates and remain completely certified as Organic. In effect this allows us to return as close as possible to original historical distillation runs of surplus farm grain to generate that seaons whisky and so embody the terroir or seasons growing conditions in a single dram.My tasting notes:Appearance: Light champagne gold (3/20), medium-fine tears and medium slightly oily legs.Nose: Vanilla and honey, light barley malt, sweet apple pie with vanilla and white chocolate ice cream, a pinch of powdered cinnamon.Taste: Creamy, malty, crisp barley,  a little earthy and nutty, sweet and sharp clear apple juice, white chocolate buttons.Finish:Medium-long, vanilla, citrus juice and peel, woody oak.", £72.95 from The Whisky Exchange

It was here that Allardice discovered the rich depths of sherry cask maturation; marrying robust Highland spirit to Spanish cask, a tradition carried forward by The GlenDronach to this day.James Allardice lived most of his life at Boynsmill House (later re-named Glen House) and was often known to share a dram of his ‘Guid GlenDronach’ with friends and neighbours. This historic home continues to welcome guests at The GlenDronach distillery to this day.At this time in the early 19 th Century, both sherry and port were popularly enjoyed by Scotland’s gentry and their influence on Single Malt Scotch Whisky is still prominent today.The GlenDronach Boynsmill Aged 16 Years is a marriage of rich Pedro Ximénez and Oloroso sherry casks from Andalucía, with the subtle influence of the finest port casks from the Douro Valley in Portugal. The GlenDronach Boynsmill Aged 16 Years pays a fitting homage to the distillery’s heritage and the warmth and hospitality of its founder.The GlenDronach Master Blender, Dr Rachel Barrie said:“The GlenDronach Boynsmill Aged 16 Years celebrates the rich heritage of The GlenDronach, with a small number of casks hand-selected to showcase its robust and complex Highland character. I hope whisky travellers will enjoy this rare opportunity to savour the depth of a truly old-style Highland Single Malt. Pedro Ximénez and Oloroso sherry casks express the rich and full-bodied signature style of The GlenDronach, while port casks from the Douro Valley subtly influence the balance of fruit, recognisable in the ‘Valley of the Brambles’. As a complex and supremely balanced Single Malt, The Glendronach Boynsmill Aged 16 Years has notes of plum pudding and apricot brandy on the nose, layered with the warmth of nutmeg and quince.

The GlenDronach is of true Highland style: a full-bodied taste, perfect for long maturation in sherry casks. At The GlenDronach Distillery, we have carried forth the tradition of our founder James Allardice since 1826, maturing our whisky in the finest Spanish Pedro Ximénez and Oloroso sherry casks from Andalucía. We continue to work towards mastering the art of sherry cask maturation, and our Highland whiskies are recognized for their deep colour and rich flavour profiles, which range from sweet fruity flavours, from the Pedro Ximénez casks we select, to the dry and nutty notes, from superb Oloroso casks. Our well-kept secrets have been guarded for nearly 200 years by a parliament of rooks who love The GlenDronach so much they try to nest in the warehouses. The distillery folk believe as long as the rooks remain at the distillery, it will be good for the whisky.Inspired by the historical import of casked port into Scotland during the 19th century, The GlenDronach distillery is pleased to announce the release of The GlenDronach Port Wood. The GlenDronach distillery was established in 1826 by founder James Allardice, at a time when both sherry and port were ‘de rigueur’, with the finest port pipes travelling along Portugal’s Douro River, destined for the wine cellars of Scotland’s gentry.Made by our craftsmen using the same, time-honoured methods passed down through generations for almost two hundred years, The GlenDronach’s rich, full bodied Highland spirit has been matured in the distillery’s signature Pedro Ximénez and Oloroso sherry casks, followed by a second maturation in some of the finest port pipes from the majestic Douro Valley of Portugal.Expertly selected and married by The GlenDronach Master Blender, Dr Rachel Barrie, The GlenDronach Port Wood is a rich and fruity ten-year-old limited release to be savoured.Master Blender, Dr Rachel Barrie said:“The GlenDronach means ‘valley of the brambles’ in old Scots Gaelic. We are delighted to celebrate this heritage with a Portuguese twist on our revered Pedro Ximénez and Oloroso sherry cask maturation, which uses the finest Spanish oak. This extra maturation in Port casks imparts a deep cherry wood colour and enriches the layers of fruit in The GlenDronach, with delightful waves of Victoria plum, brambles and sandalwood on the nose. Layers upon layers of rich fruit flavour open up on the palate with notes of roasted apple crumble and gingerbread, developing into baked orange and black cherry back-notes.”The GlenDronach Port Wood is bottled at 46% ABV, and as is the case for all The GlenDronach expressions, is non-chill filtered and absorbs colour naturally over time from the Spanish oak in which it resides. It will be available to buy from specialist retailers worldwide from June.Official tasting notes:Appearance: Intense cherry wood.Nose: Breathe in delightful waves of Victoria plum, bramble and strawberry jam with top notes of cherry blossom and honeysuckle on a base of sandalwood and ginger.Taste: Layers upon layers of rich fruits. Sip blackberry and roasted apple crumble with freshly baked gingerbread, developing into a baked orange and black cherry back-note.Finish: Savour orange peel, sultana and cherry cake lingering into the richly fruity finish.","A limited release GlenDronach that has been matured in sherry casks and then spent a minimum of 3 years in Port pipes sourced from Portugal’s Douro valley resulting in a minimum of 10 year maturation.

Growing barley on Islay is always difficult and yields are low. The autumn of 2010 was wet and windy. A late harvest saw Octomore farmer James Brown facing heavy losses from greylag geese and herds of wild red deer, resulting in a precious little yield. Malting the this Octomore grain produced results that were unprecedented, the readings came back at 309.1ppm. Following a carefully controlled trickle distillation, Octomore 08.3 was matured in 56% first fill Bourbon casks, the remaining in ex-Paulliac, Ventoux, Rhone and Burgundy casks.Official tasting notes:CHARACTER – This is the ultimate Islay Octomore. A thunderstorm of a dram. Close your eyes as you take the first sip and allow your senses to shut down as you focus on processing this fascinating dram.AROMA – Toasted oak and muddy/peaty smoke, bandages. Maple syrup, fresh linen, sea shells. Evokes a memory of lying in the heather on the peat moss, the warm sun coaxing the scent from the wild flowers. The fruit is cherry, peach and mango, with creme brulee and toffee from the oak and barley.TASTE – Initially a surprise as the stellar level of peat is bitter and over-whelming. Another sip opens with up with cherry and peach and toasted sweet oak, dark chocolate, boot polish and seaweed. At this level the peat is like a thundercloud, darkening the atmosphere. You can feel it in your bones.FINISH – Complex, creme brulee with caramelised brown sugar slightly overdone. Dark plum, orange and kiwi sit well with the malted barley sweetness. The peat smoke is a tremendous presence offering roasted coffee, burnt heather and a place in your memory forever.COLOUR – Golden syrup.","The final Octomore 8 series 3 has been distilled from Islay barley grown/harvested 2010 and peated to a phenomenal 309PPM before maturing for 5 years in a mixture of ex-Bourbon and wine casks.My tasting notes:Appearance: Bright gold (8/20), Fine, slow tears and medium legs.Nose: A mixture of sweet and peat, but cloying sweet, masses of vanilla and hints of linseed oil/putty, honey, golden syrup, maple-smoked bacon, some dry and dusty ash, pastries dusted with icing sugar and some fruits; apple, mango, pineapple, then salty, leathery, briny, shellfish and ozone.Taste: Sweet and rich tar-like peat influence, quite thick on the palate, fruits such as apple and mango and some of that syrup or honey from the nose, woody oak, malt, chocolate and coffee beans with a big peppery edge can be a little bitter as the peat attacks the palate, softens into salt caramel, treacle toffee, camp coffee/chicory and other woody spices, clove, and tobacco leaf.Finish: Long, slightly ashen but still sweet with more honey, coconut cream, woody and dried herbs and wood shavings/chips with plenty of char.", £165

Austrian sweet wines – full bodied and charming with an ability to challenge convention with innovative techniques. French Sauternes – casks from the Graves section in Bordeaux that previously held some of the most revered and exclusive dessert wines the world has ever seen.Official tasting notes:CHARACTER – Exotic, rich and fruity. Layered and complex, this is all about the cask storyAROMA – Peat smoke comes first but not dominant, there is red fruit, aniseed and barley sugar/boiled sweets.

Orange, mince pies and Turkish delight hint at the cask history then cherry wafers and coconut open out to floral notes of hay, geranium and Parma violets.TASTE – Warming and sweet, deep fruit and satin-like smoke. The oak feels a little dry then lifts to become toasted bread, bubble-gum sweetness and strawberry Jam. Adding a drop or two of water opens up the Islay DNA of salt spray, ozone and citrus. As it opens you find rose petal, Turkish delight, praline and more strawberry jam, all the while the smoke is in the background holding everything together.FINISH – Typical Octomore.

Most distilleries gave their teams new make spirit, but not Glengoyne. At Glengoyne, the finest whisky from first fill Oloroso sherry casks was chosen for the distillery workers’ drams.

With over 80 years of experience between them the Stillman and Engineer respectively kept us well-entertained with stories of the distillery. In particular Billy’s story about the distillery shop being setup in the old Warehouse No.1 – too small to get a forklift in it, all warehousing was done by hand in here – the sole remaining warehouse after a flood washed away the others. The result led to new warehousing being established famously ‘over the road’ – often joked as being on the Lowland side of the Highland line!After brief introductions and also a chance to chat with more of the Glengoyne family including Distillery Manager Robbie Hughes, we moved down to the new Warehouse No.1 in the old boilerhouse and kiln (allowing a rare glimpse from underneath of one of the famous Charles Doig Pagoda roofs – something I have only previously experienced at Annandale distillery), we joined in with the launch of Glengoyne’s cult Sherry-Bomb – The Teapot Dram Batch 6.My tasting notes:Appearance: Autumnal auburn (13/20), quick, medium-large tears leave medium-fine legs.Nose: Dried fruits; raisin, fig, dates but also fresh greengages, apple and pineapple, cocoa-dusted cherries, green oak wood and toffee.Taste: Fruity, cherry lips sweeties, cranberry, blackcurrant, cherry, raisin, acacia honey, demerara sugar, chocolate-coated toffee, red apples, soft cinnamon spice and green oak wood.Finish: Long, sweet dried fruits and freshly-sawn oak timber or pencil shavings.", £90 from Glengoyne distillery shop

Rich orange syrup poured over spiced fruit loaf – nutmeg, cinnamon and mixed peel. Stewed apples and pears with a handful of sultanas. Heather honey and fruity caramel.

Bottled 27/04/2018 and released as the oldest of Distell’s 2018 Limited Releases.Palo Cortado is one of the rarest types of sherry, a Fino sherry where a layer of Flor covers the surface preventing oxidation, however Palo Cortado loses this layer and then matures oxidatively much more like Oloroso sherry. In the past this may have happened accidentally, however more usually the Flor is killed by fortifying it to 17-18%. Palo Cortado is said to posses Amontillado like aromas but more Oloroso-like flavour.My tasting notesAppearance: Liquid gold (10/20), rounded medium tears leave medium legs or beading.Nose: Sweet, warming and doughy, like proving cinnamon bread or brioche, chewy malt, some sweet perfumed notes, quite sticky and syrupy, some dry and dusty grist and a hint of wood smoke and dunnage warehouse.Taste: Full-bodied, thick and unctuous on the palate yet silky smooth, polished toffee, buttery macadamia nuts, hazelnut puree, light vanilla or hazelnut latte and mocha coffee, golden raisins, dried figs and dates, a little jammy and sweet, and undercurrent of sharpness and bitterness stops this becoming too cloying on the palate, mostly oak wood derived/tannic.Finish: Long, a touch vaporous, softened and sugary roasted nut, toffee and dried fruits, slightly drying oak wood.", £275

Oban often has a salty tinge to its character, here accentuated with crushed fresh grape juice, orange zest and a hint of smoke adding to the massive complexity. This is outstanding.Taste: Fruity, pungent, seriously complex whisky of the very highest order – a glorious zesty nose and masses of sweet fruit attack complemented by salt and chewy, roasty caramel malt.Palate: The most explosive Oban ever.

Heavy duty fresh sherry masks the maltier, more honied aspects of Dalwhinnie. The peat is still there and so, somewhat surprisingly, is the heather.

The perfect dram for those in search of a very dry malt finish.","One of the most picturesque distilleries not situated on Islay’s coastline, any traveller using the A9 will surely recognise the beautiful Dalwhinnie distillery nestled in the mountains. Dalwhinnie was our first distillery visited a long, long time ago and probably one of the most frequent, we were there just three weeks ago during our travel up to Inverness.It is somewhat surprising then that I have relatively few notes on Dalwhinnie whiskies. Mainly as I am driving when we pass by, so can’t dram at the distillery, and I rarely purchase bottles these days. The last time we were there I was tempted by their special edition bottling (Lizzie’s Dram) for one of the first female distillers working at Dalwhinnie, but with little information available I decided against it.Anyway I digress, here are notes for the latest Distillers Edition bottling (expect the next out this month). These annual special release, limited edition, bottlings take the standard distillery bottling (in this case Dalwhinnie 15 year old) a step further with a finishing period in designated casks. For Dalwhinnie it is paired with Oloroso Sherry cask finishing, adding a little something extra.This distillers edition was distilled in 2002 and bottled in 2017 – fitting into the recent trend indicating that the finishing period may be less than 12 months, whereas the 2000 vintage was bottled in 2016. I’m hoping to explore much more of these series as each release not only offers an insight into that years spirit production at their given distillery but also the quality of finishing casks used.Purchased from Master of MaltAddendumAs we put together a listing of the limited Clynelish Distillers Edition bottlings, here are the details for Dalwhinnie’s – thanks to information available in Whiskybase  –  if anyone has information about missing details from this list please get in touch.Dalwhinnie 1980 Distillers Edition D.SC.312 no bottling date provided (confirmed First Release, quoted 1997)Dalwhinnie 1981 Distillers Edition D.SD.312 no bottling date providedDalwhinnie 1984 Distillers Edition D.SG.312 bottled 2000Dalwhinnie 1985 Distillers Edition D.SH.312 bottled 2001Dalwhinnie 1986 Distillers Edition D.SI.312 bottled 2002Dalwhinnie 1988 Distillers Edition D.SK.312 bottled 2003Dalwhinnie 1989 Distillers Edition D.SL.312 bottled 2004Dalwhinnie 1990 Distillers Edition D.SM.312 bottled 2005Dalwhinnie 1990 Distillers Edition D.SN.312 bottled 2006Dalwhinnie 1990 Distillers Edition D.SO.312 bottled 2007Dalwhinnie 1991 Distillers Edition D.SP.312 bottled 2008Dalwhinnie 1991 Distillers Edition D.SQ.312 bottled 2009Dalwhinnie 1992 Distillers Edition D.SR.312 bottled 2010Dalwhinnie 1995 Distillers Edition D.SS.312 bottled 2011Dalwhinnie 1996 Distillers Edition D.ST.312 bottled 2012 £79.95 (The Whisky Exhange)Dalwhinnie 1997 Distillers Edition D.SU.312 bottled 2013 £71.95 (The Whisky Exhange)Dalwhinnie 1997 Distillers Edition D.SV.312 bottled 2014 £69.95 (The Whisky Exchange)Dalwhinnie 1998 Distillers Edition D.SW.312 bottled 2015Dalwhinnie 2000 Distillers Edition D.SX.312 bottled 2016 £71.95 (The Whisky Exchange)Dalwhinnie 2002 Distillers Edition D.SY.313 bottled 2017 £65.95 (The Whisky Exhange)My tasting notes:Appearance: Bright copper/ruby (12/20), medium-large tears with medium-thick and oily legs.Nose: Warm and inviting, juicy and dried fruits, honey, raspberry and apple coulis, hints of soft leather, vanilla cream, light gingerbread and creamy butterscotch.Taste: Medium-full bodied in texture with a distinct oiliness but quite light in flavour – characteristic of Dalwhinnie’s style.

Our 2016 bottling features Laphroaig classically matured in American oak for its first maturation, married together for a second maturation in the larger Madeira-seasoned, traditional hogsheads.Official tasting notes:On the nose you’ll find an aroma of ripe orange fruits and sweet liquorice that mixes delightfully with our traditional peat smoke. On the palate our classic peaty, earthy flavours emerge with a hint of saltiness. Creamy orange tones follow and with a bold and lingering spicy dryness and nutty finish. The result is a fabulous expression to be savoured by Friends of Laphroaig, old and new. This 2016 Cairdeas has been bottled at 51.6% ABV and is non chill filtered.","A yearly ritual, which I seem to have slipped out of, was receiving my birthday money off voucher from Laphroaig immediately before they released their Cairdeas (friendship) expression in the run up to Feis Ile. Perhaps the main reason I stopped buying these was because I had accumulated the last 3 or 4 unopened as I stumbled by a chance to taste them elsewhere before I got around to popping the cork off my own bottle. I always have open bottles of Laphroaig in stock, severely reducing the chances of me opening even more. Anyhow at a tasting way back so long ago I can’t remember the exact details of I had the chance to sip both the 2015 and 2016 Cairdeas side-by-side. Forgetting also that I have previously reviewed the 2015 edition I made a completely new set of taste notes which I may well post just for comparison. Anyhow here is what I thought of the 2016 Madeira cask finished edition.My tasting notes:Appearance: Orange bronze (6/20), slow, fine tears leave long fine legs.Nose: Sweet and fruity initially with fresh apricot, a little floral, dried fruits like apricot and peach, light peat influence with smoke and ash, quite medicinal/phenolic, orange oil, estery with over-ripe/black bananasTaste: Full-bodied on the palate, syrupy and sweet then peaty then sweet again, oranges, peach, apricot, earthen peat, mineralic and briny, shellfish, paprike or cayenne pepper heat, slightly tannic like over-stewed fruit tea.Finish: Long, sharply spiced, peat smoke, fresh orange and lemon juices and more cardamom spice.", £65

Said Sherry butt was filled in October 2006 and cracked open in August 2016 by Signatory, with the whisky bottled for the Un-Chillfiltered Collection. An neat chance to see some youthful though well-Sherried single malt from Glenlivet.MOM tasting notes:Nose: Caramelised dates and brioche with chocolate chips. A hint of sandalwood.Palate: Fragrant malt shines through from the core, supported by sultanas and waxy orange.Finish: A lingering warmth of black pepper and cinnamon. A touch of sharp oak.","A rather young Glenlivet matured in a 1st fill sherry butt and at a sensible price for this reasonably infrequently Independently bottled distillery. This one piqued the curiosity of our good friend Whisky Rover, who shared a sample with us. I guess the chance to try something from the eponymous Glenlivet distillery that wasn’t a. an official bottling and b. too tinkered with, i.e. single cask, un-chillfiltered (as the collection name indicates) though reduced to a still weighty 46% ABV.My tasting notes:Appearance: Amber gold (8/20). Slow, medium-sized, oily tears leave finer legs.Nose: Juicy red fruits, raisins, cherries, red grapes, some leather and tannin, oak wood, slightly dry and dusty on the nose like sun-baked or sun-dried oak staves, malty and biscuity cereals, a little gristy – like the mill room in a distillery.Taste: Fruity, sherry vinegar, raisins, malt, quite sharp/acidic fruits, berries, quite feisty with a sherbet fizz and a little spirity, oak wood, darker red grapes and blackberries, reminded me of a tannic and oaky red wine, cocoa powder and ground black pepper. Reduced with water this was sweeter with honey, and fresher fruits, strawberries, vanilla, milk chocolate and chilli pepper spice.Finish: Long, malty and fruity sherry.", £44.71

The expression joins the classic and peated BenRiach Quarter Casks in the global travel retail range from BenRiach. The range embodies the unconventional Speyside style of BenRiach and its creative heritage of distilling malt whisky in a ‘troika’ of styles: unpeated, peated and triple distilled. The new expression was launched at Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival which BenRiach is an official partner of.Although Scotch Whisky is traditionally distilled just twice, BenRiach have been experimenting with a third distillation since 1998, giving the spirit an even more fruity and zesty character. Building on the rich cask maturation profile of BenRiach expressions, this rare triple distilled whisky from Speyside has matured for at least ten years in first fill American Bourbon barrels and first fill Pedro Ximenez Sherry Casks. The bourbon barrels add perfectly balanced notes of vanilla and spice, while the Pedro Ximenez casks contribute to the complexity and richness of this smoothest of Single Malt whiskies.BenRiach Triple Distilled Aged 10 years is bottled at 43%, of natural colour and is a global travel retail exclusive available in selected airports worldwide from May.Announcing the debut of BenRiach Triple Distilled Aged 10 Years, Master Blender Rachel Barrie, said:Two decades ago the BenRiach distillery team started to experiment with small batches of triple distilled whisky, even when most Single Malt Scotch whiskies are distilled just twice. We continue to boldly approach the art of distillation and cask maturation, inspired by the adventurous spirit of our distillery founder.I have the wonderful task of bringing out this experimental nature through some of the most interesting casks in Speyside. For the unconventional whisky lovers and explorers, BenRiach Triple Distilled is a chance to enjoy an innovative style of Speyside Single Malt Scotch not once or twice, but triple distilled.Official tasting notes:Colour: Polished new gold.Nose: Crisp green apple skin sweetened by a dusting of vanilla icing sugar, white grape, lychee and a sweet barley back note.Taste: Vibrant freshly sawn oak, pear tarte Tatin dusted with cinnamon and white pepper sauce, with a delicate and sweet floral, barley background.","Launched at BenRiach distillery during the Spirit of Speyside whisky festival 2018, this 10 year old triple distilled whisky has been produced for the travel retail sector, unfortunately I couldn’t attend the live launch event, however thanks go to Spey: Progressive Communications and The BenRiach distillery for the official sample.This isn’t BenRiach’s first triple-distilled whisky, several predecessors were bottled under the old owners including a 12 Year Old Horizon expression matured in Bourbon and Sherry finished as well as a 1998 17yo PX finished single cask expression bottled exclusively for The Whisky Exchange in 2015.Traditionally Scotch single malt is produced by distillation of wash at ~ 8% ABV (fermented worts) through the wash still to produce low wines ~ 20% ABV and then distilled in the spirit still to produce new make spirit at around 70% ABV. Triple distillation traditionally adds in a low wines still or intermediary step to produce a further refined new make spirit by the end of the process which is generally purer in alcohol and lighter in flavour and body. Auchentoshan performs this as standard as it was seen classically as a Lowland method as well as used in the production of Irish Pot Still Whiskey such as Jamesons, Springbank perform a triple distillation on their un-peated ‘Hazelburn’ spirit, more recently Benromach launched a similar expression.This BenRiach triple distilled spirit has been matured for 10 years in a combination of 1st fill ex-bourbon or ex-PX sherry casks.My tasting notes:Appearance: Light champagne gold (3/20), a necklace of slow medium-fine teardrops leave long fine legs.Nose: Sweet and refreshing, fruity lemon and lime deepens to grapefruit and gooseberry, vanilla, polished & sappy oak woods, egg custard tarts, green bananas, kiwi fruit and melon, lactic new make spirit, slightly sour, fresh floral and biscuit malt, malted milk biscuits, pine sap and pepper spice.Taste: Sour fruit and malt, slightly under-ripe or green banana, melon, kiwi, very light bodied and slightly silky and oily on the palate, treacle toffee or liquorice notes suggest over-caramelised sugars, sharp citrus, cooking or bramley apples, white pepper and a touch of menthol.Finish: Medium, light biscuit or pastry cereals, herbal menthol, spearmint or peppermint.", null

First filled into Oloroso butts in 1986, this spirit lay untouched in our loch-side warehouses until 2012 [already 26 years old], when our then Master Distiller Jim McEwan decided to supercharge this sublime single malt by filling it into our privileged parcel of Pedro Ximinez butts from winemaker Jan Pettersen at bodega Fernando de Castilla.Limited to 4,200 bottles, the 1986 is bottled at the distillery without chill-filtration or artificial colouring at the natural strength of 44.6% alc. vol.Official tasting notes:Colour: As dark and mysterious as PX itself.Aroma: Dried fruit – raisins, fig syrup, prunes and Christmas cake. Muscovado sugar, a hint of hot sand and candied peel, dried tea leaves, pipe tobacco and leather rolled in PX.Taste: The aroma is truly astounding. On the palate the experience raises the bar still further with sweet PX notes, raisins, dried figs, dates, grape sugar. Leather, cigar boxes and Christmas cake. Everything a Sherry matured whisky should be and more. The complexity and balance is retained as the marine freshness and fruity notes of apricot and apple come through from the Bruichladdich DNA.Finish: Never-ending.

According to legend, the Viking warrior Sigurd killed the evil serpent dragon Fafnir in a battle of great bravery and cunning.

But it’s strange to think of that dark and distinguished city when you see fields of barley or the green Lammermuir Hills rolling north towards the Firth of Forth. Stranger still when you taste the subtle, floral flavour of this rare Lowland survivor.A light, aromatic apéritifGlenkinchie whisky is perfect as an apéritif or at the start of a meal due to its fragrant, light body. Distilled in Scotland’s largest stills and matured for at least 12 years, the result is a floral whisky with a fresh, creamy taste.The Glenkinchie distilleryFounded in 1825 by the farmers John and George Rate, Glenkinchie operated under the name Milton Distillery until it was licenced and renamed in 1837. The new name came from the Kinchie Burn which runs through the glen, which itself derives its name from “de Quincey” who originally owned the land and burn. It was later rebuilt into a redbrick Victorian masterpiece you’ll see today, complete houses for the workers, bowling green, those two fat old copper pot stills and the largest wash still in the industry. A traditional single cast-iron worm tub cools the spirit, in preference to a more modern condenser, giving a whisky of greater character and depth.Subtly sophisticatedSouth and East of Edinburgh lies the farming country of East Lothian, its barley fed by water softly flowing down from the hills. Glenkinchie is the undisputed champion of the light Lowland style. With its interesting visitor centre and charming setting, this also makes an ideal first distillery visit if you find yourself ready for a break from Auld Reekie.Official tasting notes:Appearance: Bright gold.Nose: Very aromatic and flowery overall, like breathing in a country garden. Noticeable vanilla, cut flowers (daffodil, blossom and hints of lily) and beneath these, a clean, toasty note. Becomes increasingly sweet and creamy, with a lightly aromatic edge and fresh citrus, which all brings to mind lemon cheesecake. Water makes it still more creamy and scented.Taste: In brief… Glenkinchie at its best. In a sentence… A smooth, gently appetising Lowlander; flowery, ‘perfect for a picnic.’Palate:: A sweet soft start, like crême anglaise, soon becoming flowery again. A really smooth delivery, especially after adding a drop of water. The mid-palate is crisp and then the flavour settles into a tightly focused bundle of butter icing, lemon cheesecake and freesias.Finish: Herbal and drying, a little like potpourri.From Malts.com/…/Glenkinchie",":From a 20cl bottle purchased as part of the Classic Malts Gentle Collection set from Glenkinchie Distillery back in 2014.

This coming together of spirit selection and quality cask curation, matched with decades of knowledge and expertise, has resulted in a collection of whiskies which captures the finest moments of Scotland’s liquid history: each and every one maturing under the direction and ownership of four generations of the Urquhart family.Our first three releases from the ‘Generations’ range comprised two single casks from the Mortlach Distillery and one single cask from Glenlivet, all bottled as single casks, both distilleries representing the rich, diverse heritage of whisky making in the Speyside region.The first ‘Generations’ was a 70 year old Mortlach, filled into one of our own casks on 15th October 1938 under the watchful eye of John Urquhart, the first of the four generations of the family to forge the future at Gordon & MacPhail. Seventy years later, this monumental whisky had reached perfection and was released at the historic surroundings of Edinburgh Castle on the 70th day of 2010.The second release in this peerless range came in the form of Cask 339 from Glenlivet Distillery – one of fifteen, first fill Sherry butts ordered to be filled on 3rd February 1940 by John Urquhart. Initially left to mature at the distillery, the cask was moved forty years later to our own bonded warehouses in Elgin, where it slumbered away for a further thirty years before being bottled, at 70 years old, and released in 2011 at Edinburgh Castle. A second bottling from the same cask was released in 2012 and launched in Vancouver.Our ‘Generations’ range is reserved for our most exclusive single malt whiskies. The latest release is another outstanding single cask from Speyside’s Mortlach Distillery, this time aged for 75 years and launched at the Royal Opera House in London, once again demonstrating the unrivalled complexity and wisdom unique to this range.Official tasting notes:Nose: Fresh and clean; very slight nose prickle: still lively. A highly perfumed, floral top note – lily of the valley, barbers shop, scented hand cream, soft leather lady’s dress handbag – with a fruity complex in the middle (dried figs, pomegranate, ripe pear. Peach juice); creamy vanilla (Creme Anglaise), even vanilla fudge, and a faint trace of coffee in the background.  Water reduces the floral notes with scented oil (bath oil? Teak oil?), increases the soft leather note and dries out the aroma somewhat (warm sanded hardwood).Taste: Sweet to start, but not as sweet as expected; considerable fresh acidity and slightly mouth drying. Bitter almonds. A most unusual trace of hemp ropes and very faded creosote, lending a slight smokiness. A medium-length finish, leaving an attractive aftertaste of sandalwood.  With water lightly sweet; slightly oily texture; mouth drying; then slightly bitter finish. Some spice across the tongue. Warming, even at this lower strength.Finish: A medium-length finish, leaving an attractive aftertaste of sandalwood.","It requires a rather special occasion to sample the world’s oldest whisky, and this indeed was a special occasion.Gordon & Macphail hosted a very special tasting with this latest Generations bottle at its pinnacle, however I cannot say anymore at the moment about why this tasting was held! I can however tell you my thoughts on the oldest whisky, distilled on November 17th 1939 and bottled the same date 75 years later.One thing I can say about this whisky is that is not through a stroke of luck it arose. Gordon & Macphail have carefully curated their maturing stock, to call them an Independent bottler is almost an injustice. G&M purchase spirit from distillers and inter it into their own casks, deciding the fate of each before spirit meets wood.This cask has matured in a specific area of their warehouses where alcohol and water vapour are lost at an almost equivalent rate, allowing the ABV to safely stay above the required minimum of 40%.During the tasting we also sampled a 30 Year Old Mortlach example whose fate was re-assigned, filled into a rebuilt refill cask it was destined to be blended by G&M at 12 or 15 years old, except at its allotted time the quality of the combination saved it from that fate and allowed it to mature for twice as long before being selected for bottling.I was assured by Ewen Mackintosh, managing director for G&M that there are more 70+ year old or thereabouts similar casks maturing as part of the same ‘Generations’ program to be bottled in future.My tasting notes:Appearance: Dark reflective gold (12/20), rare medium-large tears leave thick legsNose: A gentle wisp of musty smoke and the rarely-visited regions of dunnage warehouses were the oldest casks lie silently give indications to the age, quite muted and understated at first, I’m reminded of hard butterscotch toffee/candies that take a while to release their flavour, dried flowers, there is faint wax aroma too and an indication of some fruit but nothing I could pin down specifically other than muted or dried fig and some soft tanninsTaste: Balanced and soft, medium-bodied, waxy, toffee and toasted cereals, almost bran like or toasted multigrain bread, dusty and sooty smoke, and coal tar soap [interjected Charles Maclean sat across the tasting table], subtle fig notes adds to the woody sugar/cellulose/lignin, this has that antique shop must and wood element to it but persists with a smoky quality too, great depth of tannins but again nice and soft and palatableFinish: Long, balanced, toffee, oak and sooty smoke invariable from peat-dried barley, but from peat burnt hot to minimise the phenolics and smokiness imparted"," £19,650.00"

The slightly firmer, drier notes are provided by very soft vanillins and crisp grape; the sweeter, nuttier ones by the malted barley and possibly the Spanish oak.Taste: in brief… An intriguing whisky. Fascinating and very enjoyable. In a sentence… Balanced sweet and dry nose, enormous malt palate and long oaky, dry finish – the second maturation perfectly develops Glenkinchie’s character.Palate: Essentially dry following a very early burst of biscuity-sweetness. Enormous malt character, the more pronounced as it can be measured against the thin fruitiness of the grape.Finish: A very long offering of oak.

[there is little I could add to this – perhaps a note on the florality which seems much more evident in Glenkinchie these days?]Taste: Light and creamy, slightly refreshing, the citrus is still present but is more like candied peel in a jammy reduction, the clementine and perhaps a little grapefruit peel display with a hit of acridity of the caramelised oak wood, this is quite syrupy in mouthfeel and the sweetness really persists, more zest and citrus fruit peel. [I would add a touch of pith to the citrus nature and almost a hint of grapefruit, a deeper nutty note shifting from lighter hazelnut to walnut, perhaps a little drier and grassy and also a hint of wood smoke again]Finish: Long, Sweet and drying, more orange citrus peel and zest, ginger and fudge or tablet [ The 2004 edition is less sweeter and has much more wood/cigar box, grass, nut and a faint hint of mint/menthol in here too]", £61.84

Noticeable vanilla, cut flowers (daffodil, blossom and hints of lily) and beneath these, a clean, toasty note. Becomes increasingly sweet and creamy, with a lightly aromatic edge and fresh citrus, which all brings to mind lemon cheesecake. Water makes it still more creamy and scented.Taste: In brief… Glenkinchie at its best. In a sentence… A smooth, gently appetising Lowlander; flowery, ‘perfect for a picnic.’Palate:: A sweet soft start, like crême anglaise, soon becoming flowery again. A really smooth delivery, especially after adding a drop of water. The mid-palate is crisp and then the flavour settles into a tightly focused bundle of butter icing, lemon cheesecake and freesias.Finish: Herbal and drying, a little like potpourri.From Malts.com/…/Glenkinchie",":Diageo’s remaining active Lowland distillery is situated in the beautiful rolling hills of Pencaitland in East Lothian, just a stones throw from Edinburgh.Another visit and a tour ended in sampling this again, which is exactly what I am attempting to do for our Back 2 Basics 2018 campaign.

This is sweet, with vanilla and daisy flowers as well as citric on the nose, dry and grassy and also a strong ‘yeasty’ bread dough or beer fermenting aroma, lemon cheesecake sums it up, add in white pepper and some gentle but ripe apples and pears.Taste: Sweet initially, still a little sherbet but with more sugars than I remember, caramel, slightly toasty – woody sugars, creamy, lemon and a touch of lime, that yeasty element returns, which adds to the dried barley and grassy sensation, Soreen malt loaf with a light spread of butter and thick lemon curd.Finish: Medium-long, sweet but also an acridity or bitterness to it that persists, burnt caramel perhaps? golden syrup, slightly drying", £37.33

Three more single malts will be issued between January and June 2014: a further announcement with details of these releases will follow in January.The distinctive feature of all the five malts in this rare and unusual series is that, in order to develop a whisky with a distinctive and complex profile that will intrigue the discerning connoisseurs among the Friends of the Classic Malts, they have been matured in a totally different way from the familiar Classic Malts Bottlings  – and different also from the Distillers Editions of the same single malts.Triple maturedThe single malts in these special Friends’ bottlings have all been triple matured. Their initial maturation has been, conventionally, in refill casks. Next the liquids were transferred to charred American oak hogsheads, imparting spicy notes and a touch of sweet oak. To complete the conversation between spirit and oak, the whiskies enjoyed a third maturation in European Oak refill casks which softened, mellowed and integrated the aromas and flavours. Finally the whiskies were bottled at a generous 48% ABV.Exclusive rewardOnly a few thousand bottles of each expression are being produced: no more than 24,000 bottles are available in total across the five editions, and via online retailers and at Distilleries.“These are truly special whiskies which we are proud to offer as an exclusive reward to our loyal members of Friends of the Classic Malts”, said Julien LeBescond, Diageo’s Senior Brand Manager for Scotch Single Malts for in Western Europe. “We greatly value their support and enthusiasm, and we’re confident that they will enjoy these exciting and unique liquids which we asked our master blenders to prepare just for them.”Limited and exclusive distribution for FriendsThese limited editions are being made available in selected Western European markets and via online retailers exclusively to members of the Friends of the Classic Malts so a true reward for loyalty.In addition, bottles will be available for purchase by personal visitors to the relevant distillery – though again, only to signed-up members of Friends of the Classic Malts, or to visitors who join during their visit.

Gold lettering represents the birthplace of John Dewar and the whisky’s water source, the Pitilie Burn, a source of sedimentary gold. The bottle itself displays the Royal Warrant, which has been held by John Dewar & Sons since 1893, the only Scotch whisky distiller to continuously hold a Royal Warrant since the reign of Queen Victoria.","I’m sure we have mentioned it in previous Aberfeldy posts but farewell Red Squirrel, a hangover from Aberfeldys time under DCl/Diageo rulership and part of the Flora and Fauna range of bottlings.

The translation of Auchroisk from the ancient gaelic is ‘the ford across the red stream’.The Singleton is Auchroisk’s pride and joy, an unblended single malt whisky of unique character. Its exceptional mellowness is derived from the pure soft water of the well at Glen Dorie, which lies on the estate at Auchroisk. The Singleton’s smooth taste and deep rich colour is enhanced by the gentle ageing in sherry casks from Spain.","Constructed in 1974 the first official release from Auchroisk distillery was a 1975 vintage released in ~1986(7?) making it around 12 years old. This bottling is from 1976 season production so casks were filled in 1976, aged for ~ 12 Years and this bottled released in 1988. Auchroisk was built by International Distillers & Vintners (IDV) and Justerini and Brooks but was later amalgamated into Diageo. The gaelic Auchroisk (pronounced oth-rusk) was deemed a little difficult so ‘The Singleton’ brand was born here and continued until ~ 1999-2001 when UDV/Diageo’s 10yo Flora and Fauna bottling superceded this. In 1997 Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan to create Diageo. In 1998 IDV was merged with United Distillers to create United Distillers & Vintners, forming the spirits division of Diageo plc.  The Singleton was switched to 3 other distilleries output where it now resides on the bottles of Dufftown, Glen Ord and Glendullan.The interesting thing about vintages is they must be constructed from casks that were all filled in the same calendar year, thus as they are emptied at the same time there is 12 months or less difference in total age so effectively all of the whisky is of approximately the same maturation age. A great example of this (Until recently!) is the output from Knockando, who for years have produced official bottlings with not only an age statement but also a year vintage declared upon them. The main difference between age-statements and vintages is that age-statements indicate only the youngest whisky that goes into the bottle, therefore during the marrying of the casks to make that batch, much older whisky may be used to adjust the flavour profile etc. With vintages this is strictly forbidden as older whisky would have to have been made in a different year which in wine (and whisky) terms represents a different growing or production season and may therefore introduce different characteristics from the vintage season.The Regulations state:(2) A person must not label, package, sell, advertise or promote any Scotch Whisky in a way that includes a reference relating to when it was distilled unless—(a) the reference relates to a single calendar year;(b) all of the whisky in the drink was distilled in that year;(c) the presentation of the whisky also includes a reference to—(i) the year of bottling of the whisky;(ii) the maturation period of the whisky; or(iii) the age of the whisky; and(d) the reference to the year of bottling, the maturation period, or age of the whisky appears in the same field of vision as the reference to the year of distillationThe recent victim of these regulations were Kilchoman who released a 9 year old 2009 vintage with the marketing:Though the casks selected for the 2009 Vintage were mostly distilled in 2009, a number of 2008 casks were also selected to add further layers of maturation. The specific casks, chosen by Anthony Wills, Kilchoman Founder, are mostly a combination of fresh and refill bourbon barrels though Anthony also selected three 2008 Oloroso sherry butts to add additional layers of rich cooked fruits to balance with the lighter citrus and vanilla of the bourbon barrels.Kilchoman Distillery – Press ReleaseErr.. tut tut! Kilchoman this is clearly not a vintage as it has casks from 2 different calendar years of production within it! The 9 year age statement is still fine though as the younger casks are 9 years old and the older casks are acceptable. I have no idea what the repercussions (if any!) of this were and recall no SWA statement. However it may just be coincidence but  Knockando’s yearly 12 year old expression arrived without the statement ‘Season’ and year of production upon it! It seems rather peculiar that a fuss is generated around adherence to vintages and Knockando rather than produce the next in their season series (2005 – 12 year old bottled 2017) release a non-vintage 12 year old… So it appears that their Season series ended with the 2004 vintage bottling released in 2016? In 2005 Knockando was added to Diageo’s Classic Malts range, though if this had any impact upon stock from that year I cannot tell?Many thanks to Tom of Tom’s Whisky Reviews for sharing a sample of this historic malt with us.My tasting notes:Appearance: Dark copper bronze (13/20), medium tears with fine legsNose: Coffee and chocolate, malty cereal barley, chocolate creams or liqueurs, sweet, rum & raisin fudge or ice cream, treacle toffee, molasses, slightly herbalTaste: Light and smooth with creamy toffee, milky coffee, milk chocolate, treacle toffee, molasses, oaky wood, nutty walnut, fruit & nut chocolate bars, oak wood tannins & light cinnamon spice, a wisp of smoke.Finish: Long, mocha coffee and hazelnut syrup", ~£199 at auction

Stewart MBE and our former distillery manager Ian Millar.At a time when few Speyside distilleries were using peat in production, The Balvenie decided to distil a batch of heavily peated malt, which was laid down to mature at the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland.Ever since then we’ve dedicated one week each year, named Peat Week, to using 100% Highland peat to dry our barley. Instead of coastal elements of iodine, salt and medicinal characteristics so commonly associated with Islay peat, Highland peat imparts earthy, woody smoke notes. This means that even though Peat Week is made using heavily peated malt (30ppm) it has an unexpected sweetness deeply rooted in the Speyside regional character. The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2002 Vintage) is a single vintage bottling, limited and rare by nature. This non-chill filtered expression is bottled at 48.3% ABV and matured solely in American Oak casks, providing a velvety and round taste with woody peat smoke balancing oaky vanilla and honey.Official tasting notesNose: Gentle sweet peat smoke with some lighter floral notes and delicate butterscotch honey.Taste: Velvety and round to taste with the peat smoke balancing citrus flavours, oaky vanilla and blossom honey.Finish: Gentle smoke with a lingering and creamy vanilla sweetness.",":It has been some time since we sampled a new Balvenie expression, and even longer since our last Peated. Having previously tried the Peated Cask 17 year old matured in ex-islay casks – so the peat influence is developed from the casks previous occupants and not the original distillate – it is hard to find a true comparator to this whisky. It is therefore unique and slightly experimental. I like what some of the other Speyside distilleries have been doing with peated experimentation, especially where their core distillate characters assist. So how did this one fare?My tasting notes:Appearance: Rich gold (6/20) large tears and thick legsNose: Dry, dusty, nutty, icing sugar, light & dry smoke, phenol, peat smoke, charred wood, honey or syrup, mossy, engine oil, estery ripe bananas, peach, salted peanuts, flinty and metallicTaste: Spiced chilli jam, honey, charred oak wood, oily and buttery, peated barley, porridge, full bodied and ‘filling’ but a little flavourless on the palate, like a watered-down Laphroaig, cinnamon, pepper and candied ginger spicesFinish: Long, dry, peat smoke, incense stick ash, honey, mashed banana and muscovado sugar, dry oak", £59.28

Crafted from densely peated malted barley, BenRiach Authenticus 30 years old is a rich, intense Speyside single malt Scotch whisky.Back in the 1970s, BenRiach began distilling a proportion of its whisky using peated malted barley, marking a return to the original Speyside character and flavour of malts made during the nineteenth century. Today the distillery holds a rare inventory of peated Speyside single malt, dating as far back as 1975. Research by leading whisky expert Charles MacLean indicates BenRiach was the first Speyside distillery to release a peated expression since WW2. This came in the form of BenRiach Curiositas 10 years old in 2004, which remains part of the core BenRiach peated range today. Since then, the distillery has experimented with peated wood finishes and the first BenRiach Peated Cask Strength release, an opportunity to experience a peated Speyside single malt in its most natural state.BenRiach peated single malt whiskies are distilled from peat cut in the North-East of Scotland, containing a prevalence of wood derived from ancient trees, heather and bracken. The burning of this peat releases sweet smoke and aromatic spices through the malt and into the whisky, reminiscent of a campfire in a Speyside forest.At the BenRiach Distillery we pride ourselves on our unconventional distilling philosophy, creating unpeated, peated and triple distilled malt whisky. As the oldest expression in our peated range, we believe Authenticus 30 years old will impress with its distinguished profile. It is a more intense Speyside malt which carries a delightful balance of wild honey and peat on the nose. The combination of the soft, creamy vanilla, summer fruits and slight hint of cocoa coax the palate, while the infused sweet peat builds gradually to complete the unique characterBenRiach Distillery Master Blender Rachel Barrie","Distilled at least as long ago as 1987 or earlier, this Peated BenRiach has matured for over 30 years! I haven’t had the chance to sample the previous 21 and 25 year old expressions but I’m familiar with the Curiositas 10 Year old and have sampled other Peated BenRiach expressions.According to BenRiach Global Brand Ambassador Stewart Buchanan the Latin naming adopted for the peated malt expressions produced at BenRiach stems from archeological findings of a nearby Roman Hill Fort linked also to a great battle ‘Mons Graupius’ centred around Quarrelwood Hill. Several hoards of Roman coins have also been discovered at Birnie (i.e of BenRiach’s Birnie Moss) further substantiating this claim.My tasting notes:Appearance: Dark copper bronze (14/20), slow forming medium fine droplets with fine legsNose: Initially sweet with a burst of honey and rich vanilla essence then orange peel, tannic leather, vanilla custard, fruity peach cobbler, musty dunnage warehouse, dusty old oak, milk chocolate, peaty malt drying in the kiln.Taste: Thick and full bodied on the palate, fruit and chocolate with a distinct mass of prickly peat, cinnamon, tea, leather and oak wood tannins, cigar smoke and tobacco leaf, cigar boxes and plums or plum sauce, massive depthFinish: Long, after eight mints , cigar smoke and heather brush fire", £400.00

Each cask amplifies unique notes of bourbon vanilla, virgin oak spice, PX sweetness and vinous red fruits developing from BenRiach’s signature sweet barley and fruit-laden style. This unpeated single malt is one of two BenRiach expressions to be released at 21 years old, and the other, its richly peated partner, will appear early 2018.The quality of these whiskies has already been recognised at the 2017 International Wine & Spirits Competition (IWSC) where both 21 year old expressions won Silver Outstanding medals.At BenRiach we have developed a reputation for innovative maturation using an eclectic mix of cask types. BenRiach 21 year old is the next step on this innovative journey, bringing together four eclectic casks in one single malt: bourbon barrels at its core enriched by virgin American oak, Pedro Ximenez and red wine casks.This new unpeated expression is likely to both surprise and delight, as it opens with fresh summer fruit compote, soft vanilla and vibrant candied peel, developing into tangy red fruits, barley sugar and the warmth of chocolate ginger.

Each cask was individually sampled and assessed by Master Blender, Stephanie MacLeod before being chosen. Once MacLeod was satisfied that she had a perfectly balanced flavour profile in the DEWAR’S House Style, the specially selected casks were blended together and then filled into oak casks for an additional period of maturation, a process pioneered by DEWAR’s, known as double-ageing, to add more depth and enriched smoothness.During this extra period of maturation, the disparate characters of the malts and grains are allowed to interact with one another and mellow further. In an extra step unique to the new 25-year-old expression, the whisky was then filled into a set of freshly disgorged ROYAL BRACKLA® casks for an extra period of finishing.According to MacLeod, “DEWAR’S 25 is endlessly smooth, rich and elegant. Awakened on the palate: the sophisticated whisky is glorious in its harmony and balance, gently revealing layers of rich fruit, floral notes and delicate honey, with a hint of smoke to finish.”Fraser Campbell, Global Ambassador for DEWAR’S comments “Disclosing the ages of our blends allows discerning whisky drinkers to choose an expression with a maturity and flavour profile that matches their own character preferences. DEWAR’S remains committed to age statements as a sign of craftsmanship and quality. In a world where aged stock is increasingly rare, we are proud to display an age on the front of our bottles”.The age statements that DEWAR’S proudly proclaim on its bottles are not merely numbers; they’rea guarantee of the age of the youngest whisky found within the blend. Each bottle’s age statement is an assurance that it holds an authentic and precious piece of time-honoured taste.According to the latest reports from the IWSR, DEWAR’S is the fastest growing premium blended Scotch in the world, defying current global Scotch trends. DEWAR’S is also the world’s most awarded blended Scotch with medals for quality, taste and innovation to-date. Adding to the vast list of awards to support this, DEWAR’S 18 Years Old has been crowned best blended Scotch (under 21 years) at the International Spirits Challenge 2017.DEWAR’S 25 Years Old is bottled at 40% ABV and priced at $225.

Our tribute is teeming with brown sugar, sweet fruits and soft spices.A teapot full of whiskyA full tumbler of whisky a day was wonderful, certainly, for the seasoned workers – but a bit much for the younger ones. To save face, they’d discretely pour their untouched drams into a copper teapot on the windowsill. However, it certainly didn’t go to waste. Our cooper would pour his ‘tea’, to enjoy a little – or a lot – more than the daily ration.Only available at Glengoyne, the Teapot Dram IV has been lovingly recreated by men with a hazy recollection of those times. And because the daily dram would never be taken from an old cask, this is a deliberately young, bold whisky.The daily dram: an ingenious answer to smugglingWhen William McGeachie became distillery manager in 1899, he had a difficult problem to solve. He noticed that it wasn’t just the angels taking their share from the maturing casks – the workmen were at it too.So McGeachie gave them exactly what they wanted: a daily dram. He thought that giving them three very large drams of full strength single malt would stop them having the inclination, or indeed the wherewithal to steal quite so much.

A lot of excitement now focusses on Glenallachie in Walker’s hands with perhaps batches of single cask releases (a la BenRiach & GlenDronach style) imminent? Who knows what the future may hold, however while it lasts I grabbed this ‘DE’ as a perfect example of a standard Glenallachie expression for analysis.Appearance:Amber gold (9/10), slow-forming medium tears and numerous medium legs resolve.Nose:Floury and sweet, like making and baking sweet pastries, distinct honey notes and barley sugars, floral, caramel, light toffee, a little citrus mixture of lemon and grapefruit – but sweetened and biscuit malt.Taste:Creamy highland toffee, malty cereal barley, hints of citrus fruits, quite crisp and a hint of something mineralic, possibly reflecting their pure spring water? Vanilla, woody oak, honey and cereal flapjacks.Finish:Medium, toffee, fruit, oak and vanilla", £29.95

The quality and consistency of the blend has been maintained over the years by operating a ‘Solera’ system whereby when additional 12 year Old whiskies are added they are reblended with the older stock. Thus the Syndicate blend still contains small quantities of the original 1958 blend. One of the things that sets the Syndicate blend apart from other blends is that it is ‘married’ and finally matured for up to 2 years in 4 year old Oloroso Sherry casks which we import from the Spanish region of Andalucia. This final marrying and maturation process serves to give the Syndicate blend its exceptionally smooth and distinctive taste.Warm and inviting on the nose. The hand of time has truly nurtured this noble spirit as enriching nuances of Seville oranges, bergemot, honeyed pear and fleshy mangos flaunt themselves in an elegant manner. This rhapsody of sensual sophistication continues as whispers of ginger spice, jasmine, crushed almonds and liquorice seduce the senses. This hedonistic harmony of passion is reflected on the palate. Rich and intense flavours of Old English marmalade, glazed apple, creamy caramel and marzipan drift lovingly over the tongue. The aftertaste of figs, forest fruits, treacle and apricots completes this overture of pleasure.",":Many thanks to Douglas Laing & Co for the sample of this 12 Year old blended scotch whisky.

Native to Tomatin, Douglas Campbell had worked for the distillery since 1961 in a number of positions before taking on the role of Master Distiller in 2008. In his role, he spent much of his time assessing the thousands of casks that lie maturing in the vast warehouses of Tomatin or travelling around the world promoting the distillery’s single malt.In recognition of his 50 years service at Tomatin, Douglas created a Single Malt using whiskies distilled in each of the 5 decades he worked at the distillery. Starting with a 1967 cask and moving through each of the subsequent decades to the year 2005, Douglas chose whiskies that not only have very distinctive individual characteristics but are also versatile enough to marry together to create a single malt that is a genuine one off.Called simply ‘Decades‘, this single malt is a marriage of maturity and youth. It is a coming together of sherry and bourbon influenced whiskies, of differing ages, to create a single malt that has great depth of flavour but also a youthful charm that helps to invigorate the taste buds.Douglas’ comments on the whiskies used to craft this single Malt:1967 – Refill sherry hogsheadDistilled on the 17.05.1967“This is some of the oldest Tomatin in existence. It’s a sherry influenced whisky with subtle flavours of beeswax, stewed apples and orange peel. It takes a little time and effort to identify its characteristics in the finished product, but they are definitely there!”1976 – Oloroso Sherry ButtsDistilled on the 07.12.1976“ Tomatin in its 30’s is a fruity animal indeed, especially when locked inside a sherry cask. Passion fruit, blackberries and honey dew melon are big flavours that help to tone down some of the more robust flavours that are present in the younger whisky.”1984 – Refill sherry HogsheadsDistilled on the 21.06.1984“These casks were part of fantastic parcel of re fill sherry hogsheads that I stumbled across several years back. These are some of the best I have encountered at Tomatin and I think they give the whisky real body and depth. It is definitely worth looking out for a 1984 single cask bottling in the future!”1990 – First Fill Bourbon BarrelsDistilled on the 24.09.1990“Vanilla, raisins and toffee are the dominant flavours here. This whisky has a big personality and wants to be noticed, however, it is being kept in check by the 1976 and 1984 which have equally big characters! “2005 – First Fill Bourbon BarrelsDistilled on the 07.12.2005“Young and invigorating. The youthful vibrancy works well with some of the deeper flavours of the older whiskies. This delicately peated whisky adds an element that you might not associate with Tomatin, nevertheless I think it works well in the overall scheme of things”.Official tasting notesAroma: A lovely sweet maltiness gives way to juicy, fruity aromas of fresh peach, apple and pear with gentle hints of dried apricots and raisins. Delicate flowery notes sit on top of rich pine and robust oak wood. The hint of a distant smouldering fire wafts about in the background.Palate: The taste buds are tantalised by intense flavours of tropical fruit, rich Christmas cake, aniseed, cinnamon and creamy fudge. The rich malty sweetness returns with a nutty edge.Finish: Mellow and memorable, like the man himself.","Released in 2011 to celebrate Douglas Campbell’s 50 years service at Tomatin Distillery, this was constructed using whisky produced in each of the 5 decades he worked, mixing classic old Tropical Fruit filled Tomatin with younger more vibrant whisky and also mixing sherry and bourbon cask matured stock to produce this wonderful expression.My tasting notes:Appearance: Full amber gold (9/20) medium-sized tears leave medium legsNose: Sweet vanilla, icing sugar, slight lemon citrus, lime, cereal barley flour, grapefruit, light oak wood, fruity sweeties, mixed/light melonTaste: Light but a little buttery/oily, light orchard fruits, vanilla cream, coconut, malty cereal barley, a little zesty/white pepper, cherry cough drops, rich fruit cake, a wisp of smokeFinish: Medium, light fruit cocktail, sweetened, oakier notes persist with a touch of sweet & dry", £62.86

The owner could either continue ageing or bottle the remainder (paying duty and bottling costs) as required due to the revenue raised from the sale of the portion to RMW.

The new ‘Kiln Embers’ is a smoky addition to the Wemyss line up, blended with double the amount of smoky Islay malt whisky than its sister whisky, Peat Chimney.Following its popular 2014 limited release, Velvet Fig, Wemyss Malts has created this no-age statement expression to offer an additional peaty dimension to its blended malt range. Kiln Embers is also non-chill-filtered and bottled at 46% abv. With a limited release of just 12,000 bottles globally, it is presented in a gift carton and will be available in specialist spirits stores at around £42.Like the rest of the Wemyss Malts blended malts selection, Kiln Embers is named after the whisky’s natural flavours and aromas. The whisky’s name and gift carton are inspired by the barley malting process where peat is added to a kiln to develop the smoky flavours found in this whisky. On the nose, snuffed smoke mingles with salted lemons and sweet cure bacon; while oats and orange peel toast over embers and heathery peat on the palate; resulting in a sweet smoke finish.William Wemyss, Managing Director of Wemyss Malts, commented: “When I started this business in 2005, I never envisaged the amazing breadth of flavours to be found in whiskies. Our new “Kiln Embers” is even smokier than our existing smoky favourite Peat Chimney and is a fitting celebration of our ten years in the industry. ”",":Thanks to Wemyss Malts for this sample of their limited release Kiln Embers peaty blended malt whisky.

Matured in American oak casks and finished in Sherry butts, the whisky carries an abv of 40% and costs £32 per bottle. The expression will be rolled out to other markets in 2017. Due to an upgrade at the distillery in 2007, when it was reopened following a 12-year silent period, Whyte & Mackay claims the liquid is richer than expressions bottled prior to the 1990s.Stephen Watt, off-trade sales director for Whyte & Mackay, said the new release will ‘bring a refreshing change to store shelves for existing and new whisky fans’. He added: ‘Tamnavulin distillery has been crafting remarkable whisky, full of Speyside character, for the past 50 years and this latest expression is no exception. ‘This new release will meet the needs of consumers in terms of flavour, innovation and price point.’Double Cask is the first single malt bottled by Tamnavulin since the 1990s, and while it will be the only release from the distillery for the forseeable future, Whyte & Mackay confirmed that ‘we are sitting on some aged stocks that go back to the founding of the distillery, which may help form some exciting releases at some point’.The distillery was built in Tamnavoulin by Invergordon Distillers in 1966 during the great whisky boom, and sold to Whyte & Mackay in 1993.

Left languishing for many years by Whyte & Mackay and reportedly sold in bulk to a famous budget supermarket to bottle, most expressions available bearing Tamnavulin’s name have been well-aged vintages like the Douglas Laing example above.

Thankfully the Strictly Limited range is much more affordable and I thank Johnnie Stumbler at The Nosing Arse for this particular sample.Colour:Amber with a rosy hue/white burgundy (5/20), slow and oily medium sized tears, infrequent fine legsNose:On the nose this is buttery and oily with a rich tablet, sugary and cereal barley sweetness, fruity banana, apricot and some easy peel satsumas, creamy toffee and fudge, vanilla crème brulee and custard with a hint of freshly grated nutmegTaste:Soft buttery and cereal & honey flapjacks, green banana, apricot flesh and satsuma peel (again), creamy toffee and an oak bitterness that balances the sweet with hints of lemon and lime zest, some chocolate, latte coffee, coffee grounds and a hint of smoke add weight to the bitter side. Medium bodied, almost light in places due to the creaminess of the oils in this.Finish:Long, briefly sweet before oaky, citric zesty and spicy bitterness takeover leaving dark chocolate covered coffee beans to persist.", £57.95 from The Whisky Shop Dufftown

Today, Ardbeg’s future is in safe hands: the Ardbeg Committee, formed to prevent the Distillery’s doors ever closing again, is 120,000-strong, with members in more than 130 countries.  Mickey Heads, who is the Chairman of the Ardbeg Committee, said: “Ardbeg Twenty One is a shining example of Ardbeg’s enduring spirit.  I’m so pleased we can share it with our members.  The Committee have invested much in ensuring the future of the Distillery and it’s only right that they should share the rewards of its turbulent past too.”Dr Bill Lumsden, Director of Distilling, Whisky Creation & Whisky Stocks at Ardbeg, said: “I selected the casks for this sumptuous, golden whisky as they combine the distinctive, peppery smokiness of Ardbeg’s award-winning malt with soothing, buttery qualities.  Born from adversity, Ardbeg Twenty One is the perfect dram to celebrate the resilience of Ardbeg and The Ardbeg Committee’s enduring loyalty.”Ardbeg Twenty One is non chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. It is priced at £310 and goes on sale to committee members on 21st September 2016.Tasting Notes:Ardbeg Twenty One is non chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. This pale gold whisky contains aromas of tarry smoke, Ardbeg ice-cream and black pepper, with herbal top notes.  Its peppery, fizzy mouthfeel gives way to tastes of liquorice, charcoal, peppermint and vanilla with a dash of spice, leading to a long, soothing finish of coal tar, aniseed and smoky butter.",":At long last another age statement whisky officially bottled by Ardbeg. Discussing just this proposition with Dr. Bill Lumsden [Head of Distilling & Whisky Creation at The Glenmorangie Company.] at the bicentennial Ardbeg day in 2015 revealed the difficulties in achieving this. According to Dr. Lumsden he was astonished following Glenmorangie’s purchase of Ardbeg to find that the variability generated in the Islay warehouses was enormous. When compared to the conditions at Glenmorangie, the Ardbeg warehouse on the Islay shoreline offered up a vast array of cask abv, evaporation levels and quality variations such that finding enough stock to accurately marry together an age-statement whisky was improbable. Therefore perhaps in deference to Ardbeg’s adversity, battered by the wind and sea on the Islay shoreline, and its fluctuating fortunes – this whisky really is quite special. Reportedly constructed from whisky matured in ex-bourbon casks.

It creates a depth of character that just isn’t possible to achieve with one malt whisky alone.In creating Johnnie Walker Green Label, Jim Beveridge, the Johnnie Walker Master Blender, set out to craft a whisky with a taste experience which can’t be found in any one single malt whisky.

The final 20 chosen malts, matured in everything from port pipes to virgin bourbon barrels, have created an unusual, innovative and unexpected whisky, one that has exceeded even our expectations.“I wanted to create an unexpected whisky. Traditionally every malt whisky is chosen and vatted by one Malt Master to their taste, but what if there were 20 Malt Masters? It was an experiment in whisky personality.”‒ Malt Master Brian KinsmanNot long ago, Brian Kinsman envisioned one of the most ambitious malt experiments in our 129-year history. The covert operation, (codename XX, pronounced twenty), invited 20 whisky experts from 16 countries around the world to our Distillery in Dufftown, Scotland. No one was told why they were there.The whisky experts were led to our Conval Warehouse, an impressive building, home to 1000s of traditionally stacked casks. Each expert was given free reign to explore the warehouse and select any cask that intrigued them. It was a long task, but after searching every dark corner, each whisky expert made their final decision.The final 20 malts represent some of the most astonishing whiskies under our care. From aged malts matured in port pipes to ancient sherry butts and virgin oak bourbon casks, each malt lent a unique personality to the final expression.Brian married the 20 exceptional malts together, only releasing the final expression once he was completely happy with the liquid. But he was more than happy with the final result: this small batch vatting defied even his expectations.Official tasting notes:Colour: Deep gold.Nose: Classic fruitiness with hints of apple blossom and plump pear.

Whisky maturation is a mysterious art rather than a science. Only few single malts reach very old ages in casks without losing their character or quality. On rare occasions, time, nature and patience can create a truly remarkable single malt, and occasionally certain casks, specially reserved in our warehouses continue to improve well beyond our standard period of maturation.Knockando Master Reserve comes exclusively from those carefully selected old oak casks, where our whisky has slowly matured undisturbed for over twenty years. The result is a single malt of exceptional depth and smoothness, balancing fresh fruity aromas and delicate oak flavours with a long creamy finish.The Distillery of Knockando stands on the banks of the river Spey, which gives its name to Speyside, a region of Scotland long renowned as the home of the finest malt whiskies. Built in 1898, the distillery lies in the village of the same name, Knockando, derived from the Gaelic ‘Cnoc-an-dhu’ meaning ‘little black hill’.Only the purest natural ingredients are used to make Knockando, according to the traditional methods of the distillery, honed by the years. Cask selection lies at the heart of Knockando’s expertise: gentle maturation in oak casks slowly reveals the subtle aromas of Knockando, delicate with a distinctive fresh almond note in its younger versions, it gains weight and depth of flavour over the years. Although distillation continues throughout the year, each year of production is still referred to as a ‘season’ at the Knockando distillery. Today, Knockando is still bottled one single ‘season’ at a time, and each bottle proudly states its year of distillation.Patiently matured for over twenty years, this Knockando Master Reserve comes form a handful of selected old oak casks. A magnificent example of the distiller’s art, this truly exceptional single malt has an intense nose, subtle creamy palate and remarkable long finish.– Duncan W. Tait Distillery Manager",":This 21 year old from Knockando was purchased for 3 reasons. 1; I have a certain fondness for this little-known distillery and their adherence to year vintages, more widely available in France than the UK market I have bought several bottles home including the 12 Year Old 1997. 2; 1994 was the year I moved to Scotland to start my undergraduate degree and so celebrates my 21 years living in Scotland and 3; An official 21 year old bottling for not much over £60 is getting pretty unheard of in the current whisky marketplace!Colour:Dark bronze amber (11/20) slow, medium-sized droplets leave medium-fine legsNose:Rich, spiced with hints of dried fruit (think mince pie filling), soft leather, cocoa powder, cereal barley malt, black cherry and bramble jam, cinnamon and nutmeg, walnut, spices, fennel seed, mace, clove oilTaste:Quite closed, polished highland toffee, caramac & tablet, butterscotch, with time a little fruit zest and biscuit malt open up, hints of soft leather sofas, light tobacco and cigar smoke, nutty walnut, almond and raisins begin to show, gently spiced.Finish:Long, drying, trail mix; spiced nut & dried fruit mix, oak wood, slightly tannic & more polished toffee", £68.72

This is the third annual Loch Gorm to be released and each release is differentiated by the distillation and bottling dates on the front of the bottle and gift carton.The Loch Gorm releases are traditionally matured in ex Oloroso sherry butts and this latest edition is no exception. Where the 2015 version differs from the previous year is the use of sherry hogsheads to mature a portion of the whisky rather than just sherry butts.  This edition will also be marginally older than the five year old 2014 version, it being bottled from casks filled in both 2009 and 2010.Kilchoman founder Anthony Wills said: “As well as this year’s release being slightly older, we decided to increase the ratio of single malt matured in smaller sherry hogsheads versus that matured in larger sherry butts. This increases the influence from the sherry casks and gives the whisky a striking intensity and richness. That said, the whisky retains the balance and complexity Kilchoman releases are well-known for.”",":The 3rd Edition of Kilchoman’s Loch Gorm – Sherry-matured whisky.

Haig Club Clubman inherits the same bold and progressive spirit as Haig Club – designed to be different, stylish and modern whilst incorporating the House of Haig’s almost 400 year heritage. The inspiration for the name can be found in advertising materials dating back to the 1920s, in which Haig was advertised as “The Clubman’s Whisky”.Haig Club Clubman will be available across GB from August at a recommended retail price of £25. The new Scotch is intended as a permanent addition to the brand. Further markets to be the subject of future announcements.Ronan Beirne, Global Marketing Director for Haig Club commented: “Clubman aligns with our long-term ambition to offer a stable of Haig Club expressions at various price points to match different occasions and consumer tastes.“We are pleased that Haig Club has helped to place grain whisky back on the map and become one of the most talked about whiskies in the world. Out of this success, the time is right to introduce a new edition. Haig Club Clubman will enable us to continue to drive the vibrancy and momentum of the Scotch Whisky category, in line with the brand’s strategy.’’Master Distiller and Blender Chris Clark has applied his over 30 years of experience to create the Haig Club Clubman liquid, seeking to make a Scotch Whisky with the perfect combination of distillery character and American Oak influence. He has matured Haig Club Clubman exclusively in American Oak casks that have previously held Bourbon, allowing the sweet, gentle Single Grain Scotch Whisky from Cameronbridge to interact with the vanilla, butterscotch and sweet toffee flavours found in the ex-bourbon casks. The result is a wonderfully smooth, sweet and enjoyable Scotch Whisky.Diageo Global Whisky Master Ewan Gunn said: “Whilst Haig Club Clubman is delicious straight-up or on the rocks, the perfect way to enjoy this Scotch Whisky is with cola. The sweet, vanilla and coconut flavours combine perfectly with the sweet caramel of cola, creating an approachable and delicious drink which is refreshing in taste and perfect in its simplicity. If you already love Scotch then you’ll enjoy this combination of flavours and if you’re new to Scotch this is the ideal introduction.”The new bottle which retains the signature Haig Club blue glass and the distinctive square style is elongated creating a new aesthetic and stand-out silhouette.Brand partners David Beckham and Simon Fuller are delighted that consumer response to the award-winning Haig Club brand means that Diageo is now able to launch Haig Club Clubman.Beckham commented: “Working closely with Diageo, we look forward to welcoming Clubman into the Haig Club family. From its earliest days, Scotch Whisky has attracted people from all over the world with its sophistication, style and distinctive array of flavours. We want to continue in this spirit, bringing to market a special new whisky and introducing new fans to this incredible industry.”Simon Fuller said: “Haig Club was a game-changer for the category and Clubman reflects ours and Diageo’s shared goal of continuous commitment to evolving a home-grown brand that breaks the rules of Scotch. We are excited to officially launch Clubman and welcome the next chapter for the House of Haig.”Haig Club invites people to drink responsibly with style and in moderation. Responsible drinking is an integral part of the Haig Club philosophy and as part of his partnership with the brand, David Beckham supports this philosophy and our shared belief in quality over quantity.What I Say:Generally when a whole bottle of whisky turns up on our doorstep for review I either thank graciously the small-time producer who is so proud of their new product or question the large multi-national and wonder ‘is this a bribe – when sending me a miniature would have sufficed?’. However in this instance I had to acquiesce that this release is aimed at the budget end of the market with a highly competitively priced RRP (that sending a mini would have cost almost as much) and also this product was delivered to me with the instructions to sample it with cola as this is squarely aimed at bar/cocktail culture as a mixing whisky.Unfortunately I haven’t quite had the time to play around with the Clubman in some cocktails but I hope to soon and add a little twist to our reviews with some new features. However I did as principle sample this one straight and was rather pleasantly surprised with what I got.Colour:Champagne gold (5/20), quick medium-sized tears, slightly oily leaving medium legsNose:Light and fragrant on the nose as one would expect from a single grain whisky, perfumed and sweet with a distinct impact from the ex-bourbon cask maturation, vanilla icing, light vanilla sponge or fairy cakes, creamy, a slightly chalky/dusty quality with hints of icing sugar and milled cereal flour, crème anglaise, cereal grains, a little spirity and some spices with a touch of zesty ginger, cinnamon, aniseed and nutmeg this reminded me of Fireball gobstopper sweeties from my childhood.Taste:Initially smooth and light, a slightly sugary citric zest develops hinting again at the grain whisky, becomes cornflakes and popcorn cereal with a little sticky-back plastic and toffee backbone to it. Light to medium bodied, some tart apples (unsweetened), vanilla essence & cake batter.Finish:Medium, The tartness persists with hints of bitterness and sweet caramel & toffeeOverall:I struggled to find flaw in this whisky, sure it is single grain, not as young and spirity as I may have been led to believe.  In fact the residual spirit, bitter and spice really works well in combination with the mass of sweet vanilla and ex-bourbon cask influence leading to a rather enjoyable experience drinking this neat. Furthermore I can easily see how this would work well in mixers and cocktails as it was well-structured but not over-powering in its qualities. I enjoyed this a lot more than the original Haig Club release and the RRP sweetens the deal. Perhaps this should have been their inaugural release?Score: 80/100Don’t take my word for it:Bloggers submit a link to your reviewWebsiteURL(required)Submit Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Grain Tagged as: OB, Single grain scotch whisky, Whisky Review: Haig Club Clubman ",null, £23.33 from Master of Malt

Every few years, when we have the appropriate combination of aged whiskies, we are able to blend and bottle a new edition of the award-winning Flaming Heart. This is our fourth.It is a big, smoky malt whisky with rich, concentrated vanilla and spice character. It is unlike any other whisky, owing to the combination of distillery whiskies we use and the variety and quality of the casks.Availability Limited release of 9,147 bottles. Bottled in August 2012. Flavour Descriptors A big, complex, smoky malt whisky with rich, concentrated vanilla and spice character. Recommendations Sipped neat or with the addition  of water, to taste. Distillery Sourcing Single malt whiskies from distilleries located in the Northern Highlands, Islay, Speyside and Islands.

Wood A combination of refill American oak (ex-Bourbon), new French oak (heavily toasted) and sherry casks.Bottling Details Bottled at 48.9%. Not chill filtered. Natural colour.This is a whisky inspired by a rock song.Appropriate, perhaps, as rock music has long been associated with rebellion against various societal norms. And our humble company has been associated, for better or for worse, with a reaction against the “traditions” of Scotch whisky production.We like to think of our approach as reflecting a craft ethos –making whisky better for the sake of it. Flaming Heart is an ideal example of this approach.It is a whisky that combines Highland single malt whiskies aged on the highest quality, new French oak, with a heavy-peated Islay single malt. And for the first time, we add to this edition of Flaming Heart a small portion of whiskies aged in sherry casks, providing added layers of richness and complexity.In the melodramatic parlance of a rock lyric, it is a whisky born of fire, yet one with a big heart.

High-provenance, smoky, heavily peated barley married to our slow, Victorian, trickle distillation delivers power with finesse. Here, this fascinating spirit has been matured full term in casks of finest French oak [Quercus robur]. They previously held one of the greatest Eau de Vie, from the western Cognac region. The salt spray of Islay combines with peat smoke to vie with the toasted oak and lemon barley sugar flavours of the wood to give a complex and unbelievably rewarding dram.CharacterIt’s Port Charlotte, but not as we know it. the spirit of adventure is alive with a wonderful marriage of Port Charlotte spirit with its classic Islay DNA and truly exceptional casks from the heart of France.ColourRose gold.NoseThe DNA is Islay. Peat smoke and salt spray collide with the fruit and complexity of our classic spirit. poached pears, vanilla fudge and sweet apricots. Toasted oak and lemon barley sugar notes rise from the glass as it warms in your hand. As it breathes the whisky will release festive, warming aromas of cinnamon, ginger and more rich vanilla.PalateIrresistibly complex. This dram has layer upon layer of subtle fruit flavours so characteristic of our spirit wrapped comfortingly in the blanket of peat smoke. Yet there is a new dimension to this next release of Port Charlotte. A depth of character that comes from the years of maturation in ex cognac barrels. We have watched the spirit mature slowly over the last eight years to become a beguiling spirit that shows our spirit of curiosity and adventure is alive and well. This spirit has taken us down many paths and this particular journey hascome to fruition with a spirit that is a joy to taste. The wonderful french oak gives vanilla and spice and has brought this heavily peated Islay spirit to maturity with a class and finesse beyond its years. The fruit is rich and sweet – apples apricots and plums – as is the barley sugar and lemon honey notes that reassure you this is an Islay spirit matured in our warehouses under our watchful eye.FinishThis whisky stays on your mind for longer than your palate and it stays on your palate for an age. Floral heather honey, zesty lemon and a nutty smoothness settle with the peat smoke that is always last to leave you.

Our ‘new make’ spirit sets out on its journey through life full of the crisp, fresh, malty flavours derived from trickle distillation – but it is careful management of American and European oak casks that eventually determines the final character of the whisky.This is perfectly illustrated in the unpeated ‘Laddie Eight’, the latest exclusive for GTR released by head distiller Adam Hannett. Adam’s aim with this vatting is to preserve the elegant, floral notes of the vibrant young spirit while building up the signature salty, citrus tang so characteristic of Bruichladdich. Eight years maturation in our warehouses on the shores of Loch Indaal have perfected a graceful single malt that relates to a very modern craftsmanship.CharacterAn elegant expression of Bruichladdich style. Super fruity and full of Atlantic freshness.ColourLemon marmalade.NoseThe opening notes are of fresh fruit, typical apple and pear slightly under ripe so characteristic of our spirit. Then pear drops apricot and pineapple in fruit syrup rise in the next wave. Vanilla oak is not far behind rolled in malted barley sugar and with a hint of straw. After a moment of warming the glass in your hand the floral tones of gorse and honeysuckle come through. The longer the whisky has to breathe the more you will find on the nose.PalateSpice gives way to sweetness as a pepperiness on the lips becomes mango and peach. Layer upon layer of oak from the variation of casks used to create this dram gives vanilla, lemon, honey, toffee and a creamy buttery texture and mouth feel. A second taste will bring hints of fruit, raspberry and strawberry for sure and a touch of citrus and orange marmalade. the complexity is a joy to taste as each style of toasting or charring of the barrels plays its part in bringing a depth of flavour you will be eager to explore. This dram has vitality, depth and mellow-ness all at once as the classic Bruichladdich DNA of soft fruit and floral elegance mix with exotic fruit from such a variety of amazing oak. The quality of our Scottish malted barley is evident as the sweet malt sugar holds all the fruit and oak together in wondrous harmony.FinishFresh sea breeze, sweet floral heather honey and citrus bring this dram to a close, but like a typical island good-bye it’s not cheerio straight away, there is still a word or two to be had as the finish extends into the night with a long lasting vanilla note that doesn’t seem to end.Distilled 10/03/2008, Lot No L150824 16/044, Bottled 15/03/2016",":Thanks to Bruichladdich for the official sample.

Or, more accurately, tubes of “Ardbeg-crafted molecules” that also contained sticks of charred oak. The idea was to compare their interactions to those of control samples on earth and the results have now been published.To celebrate the conclusion of Ardbeg’s experiment in space, they released this final Committee release of the super-duper-peated Supernova single malt. At 100PPM (phenolic content measured in parts per million) compared to Ardbeg’s usual 55PPM, this is one of the most heavily-peated whiskies in the world!COLOUR:Shimmering pale gold.NOSE:A shower of peppery, aromatic herbs shoots through the air, scattering particles of effervescent perfume. In its wake, smoked fruits, briny seaweed and fennel. The sensation comes full circle with the earthy, grounding aroma of vetiver root. Add a few drops of water and luscious linseed oil comes to the surface, sending wafts of sweet smoked toffee, brazil nuts and soot into the atmosphere.TASTE:At 100ppm, the peat is firing on all cylinders, with blasts of spice, salted caramel and billowing smoke. And then it’s back to the laboratory, where antiseptic lozenges, medicinal notes and zingy aniseed intermingle with dark tar and intense chilli-spice.FINISH:Prepare for a long, lingering, peppery aftertaste that goes on and on and on…",":The final Supernova released in 2015 by Ardbeg to celebrate their partnership program looking at the effects of micro-gravity on solvent interaction with wood.

We invest heavily in keeping the innovation conveyor belt going. Hopefully, we can do this in a pioneering way that respects the traditions that our family has passed down through the generations.”Built in 2007 on the Girvan Distillery complex in the Scottish Lowlands, Ailsa Bay consists of 16 stills – with wash stills and spirit stills both the same style and size – and also uses four stainless steel condensers to create a “different flavour”.The site’s primary function is to provide liquid for William Grant’s broader Scotch portfolio, but also forms a significant part of the company’s innovation strategy, allowing master blender Brian Kinsman the ability to “isolate and control more elements from the distillation, to maturation, to filtration process”.Four different casksThe single malt whisky itself is a combination of liquid from four different casks: refill American oak, first fill Bourbon, new oak and Baby Bourbon casks from the Hudson Distillery in New York.“We had an idea to turn the cask finishing idea on its head,” added Kinsman. “Rather than finishing with Baby Bourbon casks, we are starting with these. We mature for a certain period of time but couldn’t keep the liquid here for a long time as it would be too powerful.”The whisky does not carry an age statement, but its liquid will not be older than eight or nine years since the distillery opened in 2007.Gordon said while he believes Ailsa Bay will “always be no-age-statement” the brand may release an unpeated expression on the future.He said of William Grant’s ambitions in the peated Scotch category: “We tinkered with Glenfiddich but didn’t want to confuse it, and then we tried to buy a distillery famous for its peated malt, but that didn’t work out so we decided to build our own.“This is very specifically our play in the peated area. What this is doing is saying location has nothing to do with flavour.”",":Another new distillery and also from William Grant & Sons, the Ailsa Bay distillery built on the Girvan site is apparently a replica of The Balvenie stillhouse and it was intended that output replace Balvenie in Grants blended whisky (so not that far removed from the Kininvie we last reviewed). Using these ‘Balvenie’ stills they can apparently manufacture 4 different types of new make spirit including estery, nutty, fruity and heavily peated. It is from the last category that they have bottled their first single malt. And why not? Kilchoman have shown that good quality young peated whisky is very drinkable. Here Ailsa Bay quote a phenol parts per million (ppm) of 21 in their distilled spirit and a sweets ppm of 11 using a novel measurement system introduced by Brian Kinsman allowing the balance of peat and sweet to be measured and presented on the bottle.Colour:Light straw gold (6/20) small droplet tears with fine legsNose:Cereal barley malt and icing sugar, dry, chalky, love heart sweeties, sweet and gentle peat smoke, fresh fruits; melon, pear, grape, lime and lemonTaste:Sweet and peaty, lively and youthfull, refreshing lemon and lime foam with bandaid sticking plasters, hospital iodine, furniture polish, ashtray dregs, oily and buttery, vanilla and melon sorbet a touch of toffee’d oak wood and corsodyl original medicated mouthwash (clove oil?)Finish:Medium-long, sweet and gentle earthen peat smoke", £53.95

Sweet, buttery vanilla and slightly spicy on the palate.",":Finally we get to sample something from Kininvie! Kininvie distillery was built and opened in 1990 by William Grant & Sons adjacent to the Glenfiddich and Balvenie distilleries in Speyside. Kininvie is essentially a stillhouse with the mash piped some 200 metres from the Balvenie mash-house. Furthermore distillation is computer-controlled at the very modern Kininvie. Since opening very little Kininvie single malt has been sold, Kininvie was built to alleviate the demands upon the premium Glenfiddich and Balvenie single malts and as such is thought to make up the lions share of the blended malt Monkey Shoulder. William Grant & Sons attempted not to create competition by introducing a whole new single malt onto the market and even casks of Kininvie are teaspooned (much as Balvenie) with a little malt from the other distillery to prevent independent releases of single malt. Despite all this in recent years several Kininvie single malt expressions have been released including this Travel Retail Exclusive 17 year old Batch 1 distilled in 1996 and matured in bourbon and sherry casks (apparently 4/1).Thanks to Tom @ Toms Whisky Reviews for finally cracking this open and generously donating a sample to us.Colour:Rose gold with copper highlights (8/20), very slow medium-large tears leave medium legsNose:A little closed at first, but there is a subtle depth of fruit and florality with hints of red/dried fruits and lighter nutty (almond/hazelnut) aromas just belying that sherry influence, vanilla and light honeyTaste:Smooth and buttery/oily on the palate, again this needs a little coaxing, demerara sugar and crème brulee, cinnamon spiced raisins and a little cayenne pepper add heat, macadamia and hazelnut, a touch of malt and tannic oak – sadly all tasted over a tongue covered in beeswaxFinish:Medium, a touch drying, peppered honey", £75 for 35cl from World of Whiskies

From what I can gather The Arran Circle single cask bottlings were officially produced by the distillery. Arran have previously released a cask 42 which happened to be a 9 year old bourbon cask, distilled 28/05/2001 and bottled on exactly 10 days before this one on 7/10/2007 according to whiskybase – leading me to suspect this cask 42 was either from a different year (casks usually numbered in sequential order/year starting at 1 each year i.e. 1/2016 being the first of 2016). This bottling may well have also been named after i.e. the 42 cask bottled for The Arran Circle label – in short who knows this is all just speculation so lets get on to the whisky!!Colour:Dark champagne gold (5/20), numerous medium-sized tears and legs, oilyNose:Chalky and dusty, vanilla essence and fairy (sponge) cakes, slight acetone/solvent and plastic – like acetate, new pencil case, more fruity esters pear, apple, peach, a hint of zesty orange or grapefruit, pear drops sweetiesTaste:Smooth, sweet honey and golden syrup, less fruity than the nose suggests, a good depth of malted cereal barley is here, quite mealy, biscuit and flapjack are brought to mind, also a little yeasty beer and bread dough/sponge cake mix, flouryFinish:Short, zesty, white pepper and sweet honey", null
