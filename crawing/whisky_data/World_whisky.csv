In fact, the people of the Border Marches did not see themselves as either English or Scottish and therefore developed a certain independence of spirit that set them against the world. Their allegiance was to kin, not kingdom. Loyalty was to the tribe, or clan – to family. These loyalties had no border or king, but united them under their clan name.Past hostilities forgotten, this is a union of all that is good.Official tasting notes:Creamy vanilla and comforting woodsmoke are interwoven to create a whisky born of the unique rugged character and heritage of the of the Scottish & English borderlands.

However as usual I try to analyse what is in the bottle rather than the marketing and price tag that are attached and leave you our readers to decide if you think it is worth buying/trying.My own opinion on the marketing extends as far as saying that at least The Lakes are trying to establish a historical context within their local region. The development of a local fanbase is exceedingly shrewd going forward with the competition and sheer number of new distilleries. Also the development of a new category of blended malt of which we probably haven’t seen or tasted the like for over 100 years when last English distilleries mass produced mostly grain but also some malt for bulking out/blending with Scotch output.My tasting notes:Appearance: Full amber gold (10/20), quick, medium-fine tears leave fine legs.Nose: Honey sweet, toffee, hint of smoke, vanilla, butterscotch, slight earthiness, malty or malt loaf – on the sweeter side.Taste: Crisp on the palate and medium-full bodied, with oily and waxy oranges, orange oil, ginger, treacle or treacle toffee, molasses, orange & ginger marmalade, zesty orange and red grapefruit, malt, toffee, hints of clove or aniseed, earthy herbality, liqourice root, wood smoke, cayenne pepper heat, nutty.Finish: Long, sweet, treacle, bitter & spiced element, black pepper.", £64.95

He took frequent trips to England and Scotland where he sold his wine, but was particularly drawn to Scotland for the fabulous fishing and hunting. Eventually he moved to England in 1956, then to Scotland in 1964 where he became involved in the production process of whisky – from the selection of the most ancient strains of cereals to employing extremely rare sherry casks. It became his dream to pursue the passion he had for making a unique Scotch Whisky. Unfortunately times were changing in the whisky production and the old methods were being replaced by new cheaper ones. The old sherry casks traditionally used were replaced by steel or plastic. Michel decided to return to France in the 70’s to be nearer to where the sherry casks originate and he dug his own cellar in the hillsides of Bouze-les-Beaune. Here, about midway between the Andalusian vineyards and the Scottish Highlands, Michel Couvreur matures his Whiskies in these rare sherry casks (Pedro Ximenez and/or Palomino) to produce an exceptional whisky until he passed away in August 2013.

At first, the delivery feels sublimely silky and studded with oak-like honey. And just when you think you’ve savoured it all, you are surprised by a hefty second wave of spice.

Bill Lark realised that everything you need for a world-class whisky was in Tasmania – rich fields of barley, an abundance of wonderfully pure soft water, highland peat bogs, and the perfect climate to bring all the ingredients together in a marriage of science, art and passion. The vision of producing Tasmanian malt whisky was born on a trout fishing trip in the highlands of Tasmania. Bill’s father-in-law Max produced a wonderful bottle of single malt, and as they enjoyed a drink in the park at Bothwell, surrounded by Georgian buildings, barley fields and the gentle flowing of the Clyde River, Bill remarked to Max, “I wonder why there isn’t anyone making malt whisky in Tasmania”. Lark Distillery began as a family affair. Bill’s wife Lyn, and daughter Kristy, have played an integral part in growing the business. When Kristy joined the team as head distiller, she was one of the world’s youngest female distillers. Women are known for their ability to distinguish flavours and this superior talent in both Lyn and Kristy has given Lark products a notable edge.Today the Lark Distillery is one of Australia’s leading distilleries, producing high quality, premium spirits using traditional time honoured methods. The Distillery runs an 1800 litre copper pot still along with a 500 litre spirit still. The range of distilled products includes the flagship Lark Single Malt Whisky and Forty Spotted Rare Tasmanian Gin.Single malt CSDespite its high strength, this Single Malt Whisky at 58% ABV is smooth and driven by rich malty alcohol. It carefully camouflages the floral and plum pudding notes to reveal a sensational rich Tasmanian malt bursting across the palate with hints of maple syrup and then meeting the sweet notes of highland peat. The above tasting notes highlight the true benefits of small-cask-ageing.2011 Cask 204Nose: A sweet, rich, spicy nose with a good touch of nutmeg, gives way to vanilla, honey and spices. A little turmeric too perhaps.Palate: Big and oily. More than a hint of ginger, with apples, vanilla cream, pears and pastry. It’s a very big whisky, and whilst not massively complex, more than compensates with a huge intensity of flavour.Finish: Lasts for a long, long time. Big on dry spices and clove-studded oranges.",":Sampled last year as part of our virtual world whisky tour.

Canadian Rye was popular with bootleggers and mobsters alike who set up a huge supply chain of the stuff into the U.S. to keep their customers happy. For example Al Capone was associated with smuggling in thousands of casks of Canadian Club during the prohibition era and making himself famously rich in the process. This bottling of Seagram’s V.O. – rumoured to stand for Very Own blend as it was born out of a post-meal conversation between members of the Seagram family – contains blended Canadian Rye whisky of a minimum of 6 years old. This historic bottling appears to have been imported into Italy (from Canada) in the 1970’s during which time the town of Evanston (home of the FEW distillery above) was likely still dry due to prohibition!

The oak casks are made from American oak that has been seasoned in the open air for at least 24 months. The oak is slow grown that results in a greater release of flavours into the whisky. This reduces the astringent effect of tannins and releases more vanilla spiciness and hints of herbs such as dill and lemon grass. The result is softness and added complexity.The casks have (deliberately) been used to mature both red and white wines which eventually will contribute the background complex fruitiness to Kavalan Solist Vinhos. After their use for wine maturation the casks are carefully shaved inside then gently toasted over an oak chip fire for a strictly controlled period of time and temperature. This converts wine residues into a complex mixture of fruit flavours including lime, berry fruits and peaches. Then the casks are charred for a short period of time to release lashings of flavours such as vanilla, ice cream and caramelised sugars.The result is a more complex whisky than is possible than with whisky casks alone!Colour: Deep autumn goldNose: A rich fusion of vanilla and caramelized sugars with dark chocolate on top. Ripe melon and mango together with kiwi and a delicate blend of citrus fruits burst. Pepper is also present in the background waiting to be noticed.

The second distilling process however does occur in a pot still and produces a new spirit of 72% vol. This is reduced to 63% vol. before filling the caskets.

Sadly a few have still evaded us and a small number have been sampled but are still awaiting me getting my finger out and publishing their review.For 2014 my target was to perform an in vitro ‘World Tour of Whisky’. To kick-start this campaign I plumped for a virtual 6334 mile hop to the James Sedgwick Distillery in Wellington in the Western Cape, South Africa as I sampled the Three Ships 10 Year Old single malt whisky.Colour:GoldNose:Slightly peaty, sweet heather honey, floral, golden syrup, cereal oats, lemon sponge cakeTaste:Salty and waxy with a little smokey peat, cinnamon and nutmeg spices which build in intensity, golden syrup and malted barley a little like a flapjack (oats again?)Finish:Smooth, sweet and mellowWould I buy it again:Absolutely, I was very impressed with my first tasting of South African whisky and not least due to the added surprise of peat. We were left wondering if this was from Scottish peated barley or if peat was available in South Africa. I have since found out that the master distiller at James Sedgwick Distillery; Andy Watts spent some time working with Morrison Bowmore Distillers including time at their Bowmore Distillery on Islay where he gained an appreciation of Islay malts. I suspect that the peated element in this 10 Year Old expression has its roots back in peat-dried malted barley from Islay (either Bowmore’s own maltings or the Port Ellen maltings perhaps?). Regardless of its origin the peated element is incorporated beautifully into this expressions that somehow consists of a combination of Speyside and Maritime-like malt than a true Islay or (Scottish) Highland style.At 10 Years Old this is reasonably complex and drinkable with that distinct peaty element it reminds me both of Bunnahabhain and Bruichladdich expressions – so it rates amongst distinguished company. I would be keen to explore how the Three Ships distillate ages. There was plenty of room in this dram for a little more wood and body to introduce a little more complexity, lets hope a 12, 15 or even an 18 year old sails across our horizon sometime soon.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: South Africa Tagged as: 10 Years Old, 86 points, Alcohol by volume, Cape Town, James Sedgwick Distillery, Peat, Single malt whisky, Ten Years Old, Three Ships, Three Ships 10 Years Old Single Malt Whisky (Official Bottling), Uncategorized, Wellington, Western Cape, Whisky, World - South Africa ",£40

The most similar whisky I have tried to this is the Balvenie 17 Years Old Peated cask, manufactured by the same process [having bourbon-matured and ex peaty scotch-matured casks married together in the final expression] which is probably a lot older/more mature but equally much more expensive!

This fine whisky captures the true spirit of Wales.The Penderyn Sherrywood in this bottle has been aged in ex-bourbon barrels and ex-Oloroso sherry casks to bring out its rich fruity flavour. At a generous 46% ABV, it has the classic Penderyn freshness, while aromas of dark fruit and rich toffee mingle with green apples and hazelnuts to create a deeper mystery. On the palate rich sweetness gives way to refreshing dryness, yet sweet notes of toffee and sultana persist in the long finish.",":The second in the Penderyn miniature collection after the Penderyn Madeira, was the Penderyn Sherrywood. As we really liked the Madeira finish, this had a lot to live up to! We were also keen to see how much of the Penderyn core distillate flavours carried through each of the expressions and how they combined with the cask-maturation finishes.Colour:Rose goldNose:Sweet and floral on the nose again with hints of peach, orange but also lots of tannins and dried leatherTaste:Smooth candy sweetness, toffee popcorn, buttery, hints of raisins and a little red fruits or fruit syrupFinish:The finish was full of sultana and brown [Demerara] sugar flavours and reminded me a little of spiced golden rumWould I buy it again:Whilst I love a good sherry-finished whisky, sadly this one didn’t surpass the [Penderyn] Madeira finish for us, for me the Sherry influence is almost too light. There is plenty on the nose and many of the flavours come through on the palate and into the finish [with no sulphuric or rubbery elements at all] I like mine a little deeper into the deep fruits and nutty chocolate spectrum. Whilst there is a beautiful balance between the sherry and bourbon influences which allows the floral perfumery of the Penderyn distillate to come through I would be more inclined to go for a pure sherry-matured expression if one becomes available in the future…Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Wales Tagged as: 81 points, Alcohol by volume, Barrel, Madeira, NAS, Oloroso, Penderyn, Sherry, Single malt whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky, World - Wales ",£35

The palate is crisp and finely rounded, with the sweetness to balance an appetising dryness. Notes of tropical fruit, raisins and vanilla persist in the finish.Winner of the Best World Whisky, Gold Medal at the 2012 International Whisky Competition",":I had been wanting to try non-scotch whisky for a while and came across this sampler set from the Penderyn distillery in Wales. Consisting of 3 x 5cl bottles of their finished expressions [Madeira, Sherrywood & Peated], this set cost around £12 in the duty free shop. The Penderyn Madeira is a rather perky and quirky little dram, the sweet floral malt combines well with the Madeira cask maturation which adds a fruity sweetness and depth.Colour:Full goldNose:Sweet perfumed, peach jelly, malted barley and floral hyacinthsTaste:Sweet, mellow and warming, like molten brandy butter on tarte aux peches with vanilla custard, some cereal barley malt and almond with apricot come through like battenburg sponge cakeFinish:Peach and apricot fruits, honey sweetness, slightly sour aftertaste and eventually the finish lacks a little depth to back up the punch of the peachy flavours becoming almost synthetic [i.e. peach flavouring]Would I buy it again:Of the three Penderyn expressions we tried this definitely came out on top as the favourite! The Madeira finish really compliments the core distillate flavours of the Penderyn whisky and adds complexity, body and depth as well as distinct fruity flavours. This expression is the one I would be most tempted to purchase a 70cl bottle of, and luckily for me it is available in our local supermarket [ASDA] so I’ll be expecting to be stocking a bottle in the cupboard soon then!Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Wales Tagged as: 83 points, Alcohol by volume, ASDA, Barrel, Finishing (whisky), Madeira, Malt, NAS, Penderyn, Scotland, Single malt Scotch, Single malt whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky, World - Penderyn, World - Wales ",£35

Still at 40%, this is Edition Originale after it has spent a final few months in Sherry casks. While it is safe to say the standard Armorik was pleasant enough but most definitely did not bowl me over, this one came as quite a surprise…Colour:Blood orange gold with hints of rubyNose:Herbal star anise and spices, floral lilacs very fragrant like Thai cookery, dry suede leather from the sherry influence. This really reminded me of damn good sherried speyside single malts like The Macallan or Mortlach…Taste:Simply sublime, light delicate melange of flavours with a little bitterness but distinctly raisins and sultanas with a pinch of salt and sulphites, plenty of barley malt just enough to make it moreish.Finish:Candy and syrupy fruit flavours enhanced with a drying tannin and hints of strong dark chocolate for a long sumptuous finishWould I buy it again:Most definitely yes! I would expect to pay twice or even three times the price of this to get a good sherried speyside malt that carries and incorporates all the flavours that the Armorik Sherry Finish delivers supremely.  I can’t get enough of this at the moment! Those few months in the sherry cask have really matured this whisky into something very special. It is not a deeply spicy Christmas cake kind of dram but it incorporates the little sulphuric notes from the sherry casks beautifully. A hint of briny sea spray creeps in too, think of The Macallan matured on Islay… All-together a supremely well balanced, delicate, fragrant and well-rounded whisky that I really really enjoyed.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: France Tagged as: 78 points, Alcohol by volume, Armorik, Armorik Sherry Finish, Armorik Sherry Finish Breton Whisky, Barrel, Breton language, Breton Whisky, Carrefour, Christmas cake, Macallan Distillery, NAS, Uncategorized, World - Armorik ",£35

Initially specialising in the production of liqueurs, they carved out a reputation for quality in the field of spirits, particularly Whiskies, keeping the Breton tradition and skills alive. Its fame would soon spread beyond the borders of Brittany.The Warenghem Distillery created the first Breton Whisky, WB, and the first Single Malt in Brittany, Armorik. Our thirst for constant innovation means that today we can offer you ranges of spirits that are full of character, like the inhabitants of this region steeped in the Celtic spirits. Today the Distillery team has 15 employees who dedicate themselves entirely to distilling high-quality Breton spirits. Next time you are in our beautiful region, come and see us. We will be delighted to tell you all about our passion for our work.We put a blend of malted barley and Breton granite-filtered water through a double distillation process to make this whisky. It is aged for many years in oak barrels in our Breton distillery cellars. We are proud of this Breton Single Malt, which won the silver medal at the Los Angeles Spirits Competition in 2008 and achieved an excellent score (91/100) in the new edition of Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible.Nose: light, with floral notes, developing into citrus notes.Palate: a smooth, honeyed attack, slightly spicy, refined with well-controlled woody notes. Fine citrus notes complete the palate.Finish: light smoke and cereal aftertaste.",":Couldn’t resist this Armorik Edition Originale in E. Leclerc for under €20. So this is one of the Breton single malt whiskies, how did it compare to Scotch single malts?Colour:GoldNose:Lemons, pears and apples, pear drop sweets [esters],  sweet malted barley/cereal.Taste:Waxed lemons, beeswax and furniture polish, reminiscent to blend or grain or a very young speyside whisky in mouthfeel and taste, there is very light citrus, vanilla and coconut in here and slightly spicy, spirity and buttery notesFinish:The finish was very short, smooth and almost tasteless then a  little green oak creeps back in and buildsWould I buy it again:Probably not, it is pleasant enough but not as well finished, rounded or complex enough for my liking. This tastes like a young single malt that hasn’t truly found its character yet. Still it is much more drinkable and cheaper than many of the no-age statement entry level Scotch single malts available here in Scotland.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: France Tagged as: 68 points, Alcohol by volume, Armorik, Armorik Breton Whisky, Armorik Edition Originale, Armorik Edition Originale Breton Whisky, Breton language, Brittany, Distillerie Warenghem, France, Lannion, Malt, NAS, Single malt whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky, World - Breton ",£35

Today, buckwheat is considered to carry many secrets of good health and longevity..ProductionDistillation : EDDU Silver is produced from a double distillation in a pot still heated by a direct flame and called ALAMBIC.Ageing : the long maturation is carried out in French oak casks ; the blending is similar to the art of a creating perfume.Tasting notesGolden and amber hue; EDDU Silverwill charm you with its aromatic notes such as floral scents of rose and heather, fruity touches of honey, marmalade and spicy notes of nutmeg. EDDU Silver is velvety on your palate with pleasing touches of vanilla oak",":This Breton whisky is traditionally hand-crafted like Scotch, but made from 100% pure buckwheat as opposed to the malted barley that goes into Scotch whisky. The Distillerie des Menhirs is in Plomelin near to Quimper and the Cap Finistère [literally the point of the end of the earth] at the very western tip of Britanny, France. The distillation and maturation processes are identical even down to the similarity of the rugged Atlantic Brittany coastline resembling the conditions on the Inner Hebridean island of Islay in Scotland [though the weather is occasionally a little better in Plomelin]. The result is a remarkably drinkable and complex dram reminiscent of some of the fruitier Highland malts but with that little extra ‘je ne sais quois’ that derives from both the buckwheat distillate and the French oak maturation. The emergence of non-Scotch whiskies continues apace, and here is a Breton twist that gives most Scotch a good run for its money! This bottle was purchased duty free on Brittany Ferries.Colour:Orange goldNose:Vanilla, honey, cinnamon and a distinct spicy mix with definite cumin and perhaps a little coriander or fenugreekTaste:Delicate, honey-sweet with nutmeg and cinnamon, a surprisingly light mouthfeel almost water-like despite the thick rich fruit flavours of peaches and orange [syrupy in flavour but not texture]Finish:The finish is a little drying with hints of beeswax or carnauba wax and those lovely fruit flavours cling to your mouth and develop into a pleasantly moreish dry hay/wheat aftertasteWould I buy it again:Absolutely! While this may not be to everyone’s taste as it lies somewhere between a damn good scotch malt and more rye-whisky like flavours I think this is just superb. The spices in the nose give this a more exotic experience usually only found in well aged [25+ Years Old] scotch malts for which you would expect to pay around five times the price of this one at least.  Before I tried this I was sketpical to say the least about Breton whisky and even more so regards the use of Buckwheat, but this is a tour de force from the Distillerie des Menhirs. I hope to be able to get my hands on more from them soon.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: France Tagged as: 87 points, Alcohol by volume, Breton language, Brittany, Buckwheat Whisky, Distillerie des Menhirs, EDDU, Eddu buckwheat whisky, EDDU Silver, France, Menhir, NAS ",£26.99
