Milsean (Scots Gaelic for ‘sweet things’), the seventh release in the award-winning Private Edition collection, draws on the effect of charred wine casks, unlocking an unusual dimension in extra maturation. Created from Glenmorangie first matured in ex-bourbon oak casks, Glenmorangie Milsean (pronounced ‘Meel-shawn’) then spent a number of years in casks which had contained Portuguese red wine.  Yet before they were used to create a Glenmorangie Private Edition, the casks were involved in a pioneering experiment by Dr Bill Lumsden, Glenmorangie’s Director of Distilling and Whisky Creation.  Dr Bill arranged for the casks to be charred to enhance the sweeter notes of Glenmorangie, which created a whisky with such attractive hints of sweetness, that it has surpassed even his expectations.Dr Bill Lumsden said: “A glass of Glenmorangie Milsean transports me straight to an old-fashioned sweet shop with its sweet and spicy bouquet, with hints of sugar cane, ripe fruits and fudge. Extra-maturing Glenmorangie in heavily toasted red wine casks for the first time, has allowed us to create a whisky recalling a bygone era.  I hope its deep tastes of cherries, angelica, candied orange peel and unusual intensity of caramelised fruits, will surprise and delight whisky aficionados and malt connoisseurs.”Bottled at 46% ABV, and non-chill filtered for extra body and texture, Glenmorangie Milsean will be available from specialist whisky shops worldwide, including The Whisky Exchange, Soho’s Vintage House, Selfridges and Royal Mile Whiskies from 19th January 2016 at £75.99. Milsean will also be available at Brown’s Hotel London, as part of the hotel’s 10-day whisky pop-up in the Library Bar. In partnership with Beretta, Brown’s Hotel will transform the Library Bar into a Gaelic haven. Open from 20th – 29th January (from 6pm every evening), the pop-up will feature a display of around 40 whiskies, including drams from Glenmorangie. There will also be a whisky sommelier on hand to help you choose the perfect tipple.Tasting Notes:Glenmorangie Milsean is non chill-filtered and bottled at 46% ABV. Glenmorangie Milsean is a copper beech-coloured single malt, with a sweet and spicy bouquet containing hints of sugar cane, ripe fruits candy sweetness and buttery coconut. Its complex, sugar-coated tastes include tart plummy fruit, cherries and candied orange peel, while its finish features ginger, brown sugar and cake mix.The Glenmorangie Private Edition:Glenmorangie’s Private Edition is an award-winning range which provides an annual opportunity for whisky connoisseurs and aficionados to experience a rare and intriguing single malt.  Glenmorangie Milsean marks the seventh release in this range.  Previous releases include Glenmorangie Sonnalta PX (IWSC 2010 Gold Medal); Glenmorangie Finealta (IWSC 2012 Gold Medal); Glenmorangie Artein (IWSC 2013 Gold Medal); Glenmorangie Ealanta (IWSC 2013 Gold Medal and World Whisky of the Year in Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible 2014); Glenmorangie Companta (San Francisco Spirit Awards Gold Medal 2014) and Glenmorangie Tùsail (ISC Gold Medal 2015).",":Glenmorangie Milsean is another experimental batch expression from Dr Bill Lumsden, during which Glenmorangie spirit matured in ex-bourbon casks has been finished (or extra-matured) in Portugese red wine casks that have been heavily charred.

The house style is rich but smooth and accessible with an emphasis on notes of honey. The long fermentation time of 70 hours allows for greater flavour development as an extended fermentation encourages the creation of more esters which in turn give the whisky fruitiness.Known as The Golden Dram, Aberfeldy’s precious water source, the Pitilie Burn, is steeped in local folklore and its qualities have long been sought-after. The burn is renowned for being rich in mineral deposits including alluvial gold.ABERFELDY 16 Years Old tasting notes at 40% ABVAlba’s rare alchemy, exhaling honey, citrus and spicy cloves. Sherried and full like fruitcake, then dabs of dark chocolate. A soothing Scotch elixir for a favourite couthie corner.The newly released ABERFELDY 16 Years Old, bottled at 40% ABV, joins the existing portfolio of single malts.

Distilled 18th February 1998.,":A 14 year old ‘small batch’ Clynelish produced from marrying two casks together. Clynelish is typically a waxy/oily dram reportedly due to the build-up of sludgy residues in the feints and foreshots receiver as a direct result of the failure to clean this vessel annually (as would be performed in other distilleries). This waxy/oily quality assists in carrying the flavour of the whisky, coating the roof of the mouth and thereby extending the palate and finish. As such it is an integral part of many of the Johnnie Walker blended scotch whiskies. The recent expansion plans to double output at Clynelish have stalled and for much of 2016 no distillation at all will occur here due to the necessary replacement of numerous pieces of distilling equipment. As a compensatory measure it has been rumoured that Diageo’s Dailuaine distillery failed to clean their feints and foreshots receiver at the last annual silent period, allowing hopefully another (Dailuaine already claim capacity for generating 3 or 4 distinct distillate/spirit types for use in blending) type of spirit to replace the Clynelish component of JW blends.Colour:Light straw gold (4/20), thick heavy and oily tearsNose:Sweet and gentle, honeyed cereal barley, lemon puff biscuits, lemon tart, beeswax furniture polish, fruity and juicy pears and apples, grapefruit (citric)Taste:Light and cleansing, slightly creamy and milky vanilla and coconut milk, refreshing lemon and apple, sweet honey, cereal barley malt, beeswax, polished oak wood, sugary crème brulee, brown or cane sugar, cinnamon-spiced zesty and juicy grapefruitFinish:Medium length, drying cinnamon spice and toffee oak wood", £35.06

We questioned the rather high ABV of this new make spirit with Loch Lomond Group who were willing to confirm that it was down to the types of stills they use at the distillery. Loch Lomond is equipped with traditional copper pot stills, Lomond stills (copper pots with rectifying heads rather than swan necks) and a continuous (grain) still. Traditional double-distillation or triple-distillation in copper pot stills allows production of New Make at ~ 68-73% ABV (variable by distillery due to still size and shape and their spirit cuts) or ~80% ABV respectively (e.g. at Auchentoshan) whereas continuous distillation can easily reach 90+% ABV. I assume the Inchmurrin new make is rectified in their Lomond Stills allowing distillation to 85.9% ABV as it is not triple-distilled.

A limited edition cuvee that marries spirit matured in classic American oak with spirit matured in casks that once held Syrah created in the great vineyards of the northern Rhone valley.All casks are held full term, providing the time and space for the subtle strength of European oak to temper the cultured fruit notes of classic French viniculture. Peated to 208ppm it is released at five years old when the massive phenols so characteristic of this extraordinary single malt are at their most vital. This is a spirit with a texture and depth of flavour that is simply inimitable.Tasting NotesCharacterEnigmatic. Defiant. Forget what you thought you knew.ColourLiquid gold.NoseGolden syrup, smoke and red berry fruits to begin. The gentle smoke weaves through poached pear and apple pie from the distillation with the ripe fruits from the cask, red berries peach and apricot. As you inhale deeper, delicate floral notes unclouded by the smoke are released heather, lilies and orange blossom.PalateThe combination of sweet fruits and smoke is classic Octomore. Huge levels of peat sit in perfect balance with the flavours released from the cask. Add a drop or two of water and we get cherry, bramble, strawberry from the Syrah casks; cinder toffee, brown sugar, honey and crème brulee from the American oak burst through. You can feel and taste the rewards of our patience – slow trickle distillation provides the soft silky texture that coats your mouth and releases wave after wave of the soft fruit and floral fragrance.FinishAs lemon zest, red fruit and vanilla oak fades away the deep smoke lingers, a potent reminder of the strength and character of Islay.MoodTo be enjoyed in good company.

In fact the variability in stock was huge both from production variables to maturation in the Islay warehouses, with some casks revealing huge losses, even when compared to the recognised high loss rate from Islay warehoused casks.

Replacing Araigh Nam Beist. A deep and mysterious Ardbeg, combining French oak cask aged liquid with classic Ardbeg matured in ex-bourbon American oak casks. Predominantly consists of liquid matured in French oak. Inspired by Corryvreckan, Europe’s largest, and the world’s second largest whirlpool. It lies off Islay and Jura. Celebrated in Celtic mystery and legend, its raw, magnetic power exactly mirrors the BIG & UNTAMED spirit of Ardbeg. Technically a different bottling to the 2009 release, although it doesn’t say this on the label.Colour:Deepest amberAroma:Heady, intense, powerful. With the first sniff, encounter the deep and turbulent force of Corryvreckan as it pulls you inwards. Swirl the glass and dip your nose into the torrents of tarry ropes, creosote and linseed oil rising from deep within the vortex. As you succumb to its power, a collision of waxy dark chocolate, warm blackcurrants and muscovado sugar pulls you under its spell with a burst of plump cherries and earthy pine needles leaping from its depths.Swirl water into the glass, and observe the magical collision of whisky and water. As the liquid warms up, the seething cauldron bubbles and bursts, as you edge closer to sniff a pot full of gutsy cayenne-peppered steak and oysters smothered in hot Tabasco sauce surfacing from a mix of tomatoey beef stock and shrimp jambalaya. Salty seasoning brings a briny character with tangy crisp seaweed and smoky bacon swirling on the surface with hints of sweet vanilla, spicy cloves and blueberries.As the whirlpool narrows and quickens moving ever deeper, surrender to its dangerous depths with the heady force of menthol, treacle and chilli sauce.Taste:Plunge into the whirlpool and taste the mysterious depths of Corryvreckan. Torrents of taste well up on the palate; deep, peppery and chewy, bombarding the tongue with its intense tastes and textures. The first plunge brings forth chewy peppered steak soaked in pepper sauce with the tang of crispy seaweed. As you descend deeper, encounter a mouthful of black tarry espresso coffee that coats the palate with rich melted dark fruits (blackcurrants, blueberries and cherries) and bitter almonds. As the taste soaks in deeper, star anise and hickory dry out the palate before a surprise of chalky effervescent violets fizz to the surface.Finish:Long, deep and remaining powerful into the finish with black tarry coffee, chocolate coated cherries and hot pepper sauce, the lingering memories of your mysterious and daring journey into Corryvreckan.",":Dram #3 from Royal Mile Whiskies hosted Ardbeg evening with Dr Bill Lumsden celebrating 200 years of Ardbeg! So what did Bill have to reveal about the Corryvreckan?Similar to the Uigeadail, the Corryvreckan is another NAS/flavour (or more concept) led product from Ardbeg using French oak barriques (wine casks) for whisky maturation, giving much more subtle, spicy and tannic influences. The major debate about these ‘barriques’ was if they were virgin oak or previously held French wine? The answer from Dr Bill was well- neither but both!? Actually the initial casks used in the maturation of Corryvreckan were French oak ex-burgundy wine barrels that had been pressure cleaned and re-toasted before use, in a unique process developed by Eric Blondeau at his Thalès cooperage in Bordeaux. Sadly the cooperage was sold to a larger industrial group in 2002 after Blondeau had exported the concept of pressure-cleaning wine barrels for re-use worldwide. Meaning that these specific casks were no longer available to Ardbeg for whisky maturation anymore, it is now likely that true virgin French oak casks are used for all the ‘newer’ Corryvreckan batches of ~4,000 x 9 litre cases each year since 2009.Again I originally reviewed Corryvreckan in 2013 from a bottle I’d had for a while.Colour:Rich golden amber (10/20), medium sized droplet tears, slow and oilyNose:Spiced gingerbread, mildly sweet and spicy, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, earthy peat smoke, marzipan,Taste:Peaty, smoky and earthy, again that gingerbread, rye bread and madeira cake, mildly sweet but with lots of savoury and herbal spice, tobacco leaf and cigars, cigar boxes, sandalwood, tannic and dryingFinish:Long, peaty and drying new oak/pencil shavings",null

At full strength, the initial aroma is a beguiling mix of warm Christmas cake, walnut oil and parma violets fused with fresh ocean spice, cedar and pine needles falling from the Christmas tree. A smouldering smoky coal fire and the deep scent of well-oiled leather brings warmth to the scene. The sweetness of treacle toffees and chocolate-coated raisins bring indulgence through the smoke.With water, the deep smokiness increases in intensity, reminiscent of a Christmas pudding on fire. Tarry smoke and diesel engine oil enter the room bringing smells of an age gone by. Rich flowering currants and warm baked banana and walnut bread are served with simmering mocha espresso.Palate:Full flavoured and rich with a deep mouth-coating texture, the taste is an intriguing balance between sweet, spicy and deep smoky flavours.The flavour is initially sweet as Christmas cake begins to soak into the tongue. A burst of winter spices sets off a smoky-spicy explosion countered by a sumptuous mid-palate of honey glazed smoked food and chewy treacle. Waves of deep smoky tones and rich aromas build up on the palate like a fine Montecristo cigar.Finish:Amazingly long and chewy with lingering raisiny, deep mocha tones and rich aromatic smoke into the perfectly integrated finish.RMW Staff Tasting Notes (earlier batch)Nose: Rich, fruity, musty and leathery.

Great balance and surprisingly drinkable at cask strength.Overall: Amazing, but intense!",":Another review of Ardbeg’s Uigedail!?Well for good reason I should add. I originally reviewed the Uigeadail back in September 2013 from a bottle I purchased at World Duty Free at Edinburgh Airport, likely bottled ~ 2009 or 2010. The sample reviewed here was tasted during an evening with Dr Bill Lumsden at Royal Mile Whiskies hosted Ardbeg tasting in celebration of their 200 year anniversary in 2015. During this tasting there was a free question and answer session, to which I posed to Bill the potential for drift in these NAS expressions and he very positively confirmed my suspicions.Ardbeg Uigeadail is a NAS whisky and produced in batches. Not overtly so like the Aberlour A’Bunadh range which clearly states each batch upon the label, the Uigeadail has deeper and darker secrets that that. Hence many will refer to a bottling year or L-code (Laser spray code of a sequence of letters and numbers somewhere on the bottle – often on the glass behind the label from some manufacturers). Some of these codes e.g. L59501 29072014 14008062 from a 2014 bottled Uigeadail state the bottling date clearly within the sequence – *hint middle portion 29(th)07(July)2014(Year). Sadly I haven’t had the opportunity to always note down the code of every bottling of Uigeadail I have sampled, otherwise I would have been able to perform a reasonable multi-batch tasting of this range. Nevertheless Bill was able to confirm that Uigeadail is produced from whisky matured 100% in ex-dry Oloroso sherry casks, but with time the overall flavour profile may have drifted as the average age of the matured whisky used in the batches has changed [i.e. decreased] in age over the years it has been bottled.Early batches of the Uigeadail varied in ABV, but a long line of batches have been produced strictly adhering to the 54.2% standard further confusing the batch issue. The bottle sampled at the tasting was introduced by Bill as having an ABV of 54.4%! So this was either an early batch bottling or (perhaps more likely) this was a standard 2014 bottling off of RMW’s shelf and Bill was havering about the ABV or I misheard/wrote down this information incorrectly but very clearly. Either way the chance of this being the same batch as reviewed previously was highly unlikely so I reviewed it again (plus I like from time-to-time to re-review whisky to see how calibrated my palate and scoring system is)Colour:Ruby & copper amber (11/20), medium sized droplet tearsNose:Tar and oil, spiced sweet leather, cinnamon and clove, gingerbread, gunpowder and cordite, peat smoke, sherry fruitsTaste:Meaty and fruity, prunes, raisins, spiced with plenty of hot red and black pepper, heavy oily peat smoke, dark chocolate and maltFinish:Long and smoky, slightly drying and tannic",null

Launched by the Benromach Distillery Company Ltd, the 15 Years Old is available now with a RSP of £48.99 (prices may vary in export markets because of duty and import taxes). As with all Benromach whiskies, the 15 Years Old is hand-crafted by just three distillers using the finest natural ingredients at the Forres distillery.Benromach was bought over by Gordon & MacPhail in 1993 and carefully restored. It opened once again in 1998 by HRH Prince Charles and has since gained a reputation for producing an innovative range of distinctive Speyside whiskies with pre-1960s character. Ewen Mackintosh, Chief Operating Officer of Gordon & MacPhail which owns the Benromach Distillery Company Ltd, said: “The Benromach story is a remarkable one, and the launch of the 15 Years Old marks a significant milestone in the distillery’s history.“The whisky has a great deal of character and we hope it will appeal to whisky lovers who have tried other Benromach single malts and to those who would like to see what a classic pre-1960s Speyside malt is like.”The packaging for Benromach 15 Years Old adopts the same design principles as the 10 Years Old, with the addition of gold effect detailing to highlight the premium nature of the product.

Bringing the grand total of The Singleton whiskies to four separate distilleries (Dufftown [Europe], Glen Ord [Asia], Glendullan [US] and previously Auchroisk). Making some of us question if Diageo really had a clue what calling their whiskies ‘The Singleton’ really meant? Unless they were taking the pure mathematical approach of “A set which contains exactly one element.” That element being whisky, er.. whisky from different distilleries. Anyway all this nonsense and recollecting of random conversations between whisky geeks is a sure fire way of highlighting that I don’t really have a lot to say for Glendullan distillery, or its whisky. This was to be the ticking off of the last whisky I sampled from all of the operative distilleries in Scotland, however new ones are opening at such a pace that was never going to be achievable, I recently sampled 3 expressions of Glendullan. Perhaps tellingly during our visit of Dufftown we managed to visit every distillery except Glendullan or Glendullen as it appears to be having an identity crisis on Google maps…Appearance:Champagne gold (2/20), medium fine elongated tears with fine legsNose:Sweet custard vanilla, almost cloying, egg custard pastries dusted with cinnamon spice, dusty, oak wood, biscuit barley malt, with water a little wood polish and more feints/spirit nature is revealedTaste:Fruity, apples and pears, zesty apple skin, citric, quite thin and light-bodied, syrup, honey, malt, acidic green apples, feints/spirit, lightly acidic and ‘green’ hints of white pepper and cinnamon spice.Finish:Medium, fruit, sharp/citric apples, lime zest, green oak wood",null

In Jim Murray’s “Whisky Bible 2004” he says this:- ‘such a massive introduction to the palate: soft oils, citrus notes and very big oak on the malt, but sweet enough to chew forever; the integration of the oak really makes for some finish: long, hints of bitter roast coffee against the sweet oils; the nose makes you say oh-oh, but you need a knife, fork spoon and napkin for the taste’.We were awarded a grand gold medal by Monde Selection in 1999 and again in 2000.

Proudly named after its strength (in proof 105 not ABV of 60%). This is the classic Glenfarclas, the sherry-monster, paired with rather fine Emilio Lustau East India Solera Sherry. So this being the Giving Tree tasting (and a Glenfarclas) you could be forgiven for thinking this was matured in Sherry Casks, right? WRONG! (Waaaah!…).  They even state Sherried fruit in the official taste notes, however  the 105 is actually matured in Spanish wine casks that have produced a sherry-like wine but is unable to be called Sherry as it is made outwith the protected (by Spanish Law) Sherry region between Cadiz, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. Rumour has it that the 105 is actually matured in ex-Huelva wine casks. Huelva’s wines are made with Zalema, the indigenous white grape of the region. Traditionally it is used to make an amber-coloured, oloroso-style, fortified wine, Condado Viejo. This earthy, nutty, mouth filling wine goes well with the famous hams of the Huelva sierras. Sadly Huelva wines are not widely available out of the Huelva region so the 105 was paired with a solera vatting from Lustau that uses a mixture of sherry types.My tasting notes:Colour: Dark copper gold (12/20), medium tearsNose: Dark fruits, raisin, fig, date, earthy and dusty, a distinct lack of leather, nutty almonds, cocoa and a slightly musty smell like old socks/sweaty feet, hints of cheese and sulphurTaste: Fruity, dark fruits, bramble, raisin, blackcurrant, red grapes, fig, date, a little dark chocolate, almond and walnut, cereal barley malt, some honeyed sweetness, spiced with cinnamon and nutmegFinish: Medium-long, spiced rum and raisin",null

During the prohibition-era in the U.S. many inventive ways (both legally and illegally) were found to get around what was basically an unenforceable ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol. One of my favourite anecdotes from this period is that the super-peaty Laphroaig whisky from Islay was so full of phenols that it was considered purely medicinal as nobody would drink it for pleasure. In actual fact it was legal for medical doctors to prescribe alcohol (whisky?) for medicinal purposes. The extent to which this took place made a mockery of the law, much of the medicinal whisky (or correctly – whiskey) came from the hundreds of distillers still in the U.S. producing spirit “unexcelled for medical purposes” but in practicality was exactly the same content in the bottle as pre-prohibition.

This is the latest in a long tradition at Milroy’s of Soho of selecting single casks by hand, and a welcome addition to our range of collectible and scarce bottlings. Below is our account of how number 10999 became the chosen cask, yielding just 146 bottles.Back in June we were sent on a secret mission to Glen Garioch; one of Scotland’s oldest distilleries, founded in 1797. Distillery Manager Kenny Grant (son of previous manager ‘Digger’ Grant – so named because he  had a digger) gave us the grand tour, through the barns with their malting floors, a large mash tun and washbacks, before entering the distillery warehouses, filled with rows of casks stacked high on top of one another, containing slowly maturing whisky.While touring the distillery we were almost carried away by Kenny’s infectious enthusiasm and intriguing knowledge. We had however a mission to complete: to return with an impeccable cask of whisky that could bear the name of Milroy’s of Soho. We were presented with a selection of cask samples from 1989 through 1978 for our contemplation – this is the part we enjoy most! We took some time to savour the unique flavours of each whisky, all enticing in their own individual ways, but it was one little dram that showed that elusive spark; it seemed almost supernaturally difficult to pin down…We went to Glen Garioch in search of a very special bottling that we could proudly present to our knowledgeable and discerning customers; something remarkable, supremely elegant, and with such complexity as to reveal extraordinary flavours with every sip. It should reward lengthy contemplation. Our aim was not driven by concern for budget or profit margin, nor did we have a marketing campaign in mind. We were simply looking for something a little different – certainly not a one-dimensional crowd-pleasing blockbuster – something that would delight true whisky enthusiasts. We found our answer in Glen Garioch 1978 cask no.10999; this little gem takes its time to open up, but when it does its subtle complexity is mind-boggling, packed with revelatory moments. This is a connoisseur’s dram: pour yourself a glass and experience something rather different from the mainstream.",":Sampled during Milroy’s of Soho Tweet Tasting 2Nose:new paint, esters/banana, pineapple, sweet sherbet!Palate:Sweet pineapple cubes, faint oak wood, ginger, cardamom and cinnamon, cask strength?

Originating in the English village of Cheddar in Somerset. Smoke-curing is typically done in one of two ways: cold-smoking and hot-smoking. The cold-smoking method (which can take up to a month, depending on the food) smokes the food at between 20° to 30° C. Hot-smoking partially or completely cooks the food by treating it at temperatures ranging from 40° to 90° C. Another method of “curing” used in less expensive cheeses is to use artificial smoke flavoring to give the cheese a smoky flavoring and food coloring to give the outside the appearance of having been smoked in the more traditional manner.In this combination Richard had specifically picked out a peated Islay whisky and a smoky oak smoked cheddar cheese to illustrate beautifully how whisky can be very peaty but without being smoky. Due to its climate Islay peat is unusually high in phenolic compounds and is produced from a mixture of the local fauna plus a liberal dash of seaweed and salt spray compacted over 1,000s of years. Usually the peat burns with an oily smoke which it imparts into the barley when used for drying the malt. Peaty influences however can range from earthy (as here) through smouldering  heather & bracken to outright smoke. The cheddar cheese has been cured using oak chip smoking and develops a very smoky flavour which is in stark contrast but still complimentary to the earthy peat flavour in the whisky.Colour:Dark, sherried ruby amber gold/old amontillado (16/20), large droplets with thick legsNose:Earthy peat, polished oak wood and new paint, sherry, leather, chocolate, toffee, briny sea sprayTaste:Earthen and only slightly smoky peat, brown/demerara sugar, leathery tannins, prunes and a liberal sprinkling of smoked sea salt on rich dark chocolateFinish:Long with rich juicy fruits and drying leather tannins",£54.34

It’s massive back home and is fortunately now getting out into the wider world again. 40% ABV.Sang Som rum is produced from the finest molasses and then aged in oak casks before being blended to produce this drink. Itwas first introduced into the Thailand market in 1977. Now, 30 years on it is the most successful beverage in the history of Thailand’s liquor industry. Sang Som was created by Chula Kanchanakaksha who is widely acknowledged as the “liquor genius” of Thailand for his unique ability to balance both the art and science of spirit blending. Continuous improvement has been made to Sang Som via an ageing process of at least three years, resulting in a distinctly mellow flavour and aromatic nose.The complex taste and fragrance of Sang Som result in a unique partnership with soft drinks and fresh juices, making it the classic ingredient to any cocktail or blended beverage. In fact, it is a great favourite in the Khaosan Road area of Bangkok where tourists combine Sang Som and a mixer in a small bucket with ice, complete with a straw for each drinker – a lovely way to share the taste of Sang Som!1982 and 1983 saw Sang Som consecutively awarded with Gold Awards for taste in both Madrid and Dusseldorf. With these gold medals proudly displayed on each Sang Som label, the brand is now widely known among Thai consumers as “Sang Som Rianthong”, meaning Sang Som Gold Medals. Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Blends Tagged as: 77 points, Blended Scotch Whisky, Blended whisky, Gaelic Whisky Company, MacNaMara, MacNaMara Rum Cask Finish Blended Scotch Whisky, NAS, Scotch, Uncategorized, Whisky ",£18.15

He captured a flame from the heart of Mount Olympus and carried it back to man, hidden in a giant fennel stalk.Today, the spirit of Prometheus lives on as champion of man and bringer of fire. Twenty-six years ago, one of the Olympians of Speyside created a new form of malt: a whisky that combined the peaty fire of the Islands with the rich, bright, complexity of the Highlands.Like all great malts, time was needed for this new Titan to build character and maturity. But as the young whisky lay sleeping, hidden from expectant eyes, the heavens shifted. The whisky’s creator departed and a malt that was both sophisticated and powerful was seen by some to be a threat.Protectors of the orphan Titan kept him solitary and hidden for a total of twenty-six years until, in the summer of 2014, they met in secret to arrange the release.

Today it acts as the brand export company for the distillery. The Antiquary Scotch Whisky has always had a loyal following of consumers in the UK, Portugal and Spain. With secondary distribution in  USA, Japan, Italy, Andorra, Singapore, The Philippines, Denmark, Russia, France, Taiwan, China, Canada, West Africa, South Africa, India and Iceland. Sales Volumes peaked at around 46000 cases in 1968The Antiquary is produced as 12 and 21 year old Superior Deluxe Blended Scotch Whiskies. The packaging developed for both ages is particularly innovative with the 12 year old scooping a Silver medal at the 2004 Starpack packaging awards and the 21 year old being awarded a gold at the same event in 2006. As well as being pioneering and attractive the award winning packaging design allows for a more efficient use of space for shipping and shelf display.The distinctive diamond shaped Antiquary bottle is complemented by outstanding packaging design with the elegant presentation incorporating an innovative pop-out coaster in the lid , featuring three of Scotland’s most  famous castles, Edinburgh , Culzean and Eilean Donan. The Antiquary brand is stepped in history but its modern award winning design makes it appealing to a broad spectrum of age groups and to both men and woman.Blending The AntiquaryThe Antiquary has a particularly high percentage of malt to grain whiskies (55% – 45%). The finest available malts and grains have been selected from the Highlands , lowlands , and islands of Scotland. The heart of the blend consists of some of the finest Scotch Whiskies from the Speyside area home of complex , rich fruity and delicately balanced Malts such as Cragganmore, Linkwood, Benrinnes, Mortloch and Glenrothes. Distilleries in the Highlands such as Tomatin, Royal Lochnagar and Clynelish contribute a complexity of malt and full flavoured aromas to the blend. Soft and fruity lowlands such as Glenkinchie tone down the robustness of the heavier Highlands and Islay Malt Bowmore gives just a hint of peatiness to the overall flavour profile. The use of Grain whiskies  – Cameronbridge and Port Dundas – ensure that the blend retains a high level of freshness and liveliness. In all around 30 different malts and grains are used in the blend , all matured in American white oak casks for a minimum of 12 or 21 years.",":Dram No. 2.1 at the Jolly Toper Christmas Tasting (18th December 2014) was this gem from the back of a supermarket shelf in Glasgow (apparently).

Whilst William Cadenhead bottled single cask, cask strength whiskies without chill filtering, Duthie believed that mixing single casks together, could, on occasion enhance the character of some of the individual casks.With these beliefs in mind we are proud to introduce the Duthies Copper Stills range of Single Malts.Marrying:The maturation of Single Malt Scotch Whisky in cask is a slow process taking place over a number of years. During that time congeners contained in the distillate will react with the cask in which the whisky is maturing. The cask wood will provide sugars, glycerol lactones and esters, all of which contribute to the flavour of the whisky. The wood will also provide colour which varies depending on cask type.Each whisky cask is unique and the style of the wood, whether sherry or bourbon, will provide slightly different flavours which then create subtle differences in colour and flavour from individual casks.If the bottling of a single malt involves more than one cask it is best that a process known as marrying the whisky is carried out prior to bottling. Marrying involves mixing several casks of the same type of whisky together then, if necessary, reduction of the whisky in strength by the addition of water to just above bottling strength. The whisky is then refilled into cask, where it will remain for an extended period of time prior to bottling.This process ensures that the water can come together with the fatty acid esters and naturally occurring flavouring oils contained within the whisky, resulting in the creation of a perfectly smooth and balanced product which still retains a balance of all the individual flavours and aromas from the original casks.Nose: Marshmallows, cherry brandy, pineapple sweets and traditional lemonade.Palate: Boiled sweets, gingerbread with hints of smoke.

I bought a bottle of the 12 years old when found on offer at the supermarket. Despite having several other proprietary whisky bottles on the go the Singleton was always my first choice dram until it was finished. I was surprised to learn recently, during discussions centering on the recent Haig club release, that the Singleton is to malt whisky what Haig Club is to grain. Apperantly many years ago (~ 2007) some bright spark at Diageo figured if they packaged up a light and delicate malt (i.e. inoffensive flavour-wise) and marketed it in the right way – then non-whisky drinkers would get into single malt whisky. This was done with three distilleries, Dufftown for Europe, Glen Ord for Japan/Asia and Glendullan for North America. So there are three Singletons!Recently Diageo have changed tack slightly, with distilleries no longer able to rest their laurels on production of a single expression. This has led to lots of diversification and releases of numerous bottlings from well-loved distilleries. Personally I am mostly in favour of this, though much had been released in a flavour-led, no-age statement fashion. The Spey Cascade is one such of these, using the Dufftown spirit matured in both bourbon and sherry casks to bring something a little different to the party.This was Dram #1 in the Water of Life Society 15/1 Return to Drammage tasting on 15/01/2015Colour:Dark russet copperNose:Fruity, peach, orange, strawberry, raspberry jam, jelly, sherry trifle, toffee, caramel, light leather, sherryTaste:Caramel and toffee oak, butterscotch fudge,  fruit jelly, strawberry, orange, peach, apricot, melon, some cereal barley grist/flourFinish:Short/medium, honeyed fruit",£25

The premise of the society is that each cask is individual so distillery or region shouldn’t matter. However to differentiate their whiskies the society bottlings are labelled with a two number system. The first represents the distillery from which the cask was sourced (see SMWS distillery codes) and the second is a sequential number for each cask from that distillery that has been bottled. So this example (1.186) is cask #186 that has been bottled from distillery #1 (= Glenfarclas). I chose this whisky during a recent visit to the SMWS The Vaults after a night out at the Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh (during their festival Botanic Lights exhibition). Paula helped select this particular whisky as we both have wonderful memories of spending time together in the Luxemburg Gardens in Paris. Also I had yet to sample anything from Distillery #1.

When brought to Scotland and used for the very first time they are known as ‘First Fill’. Our Malt Master samples the aged whisky, cask by cask and selects only those characterised by sweetness and subtle vanilla oak to be bottled as The Balvenie Single Barrel First Fill. A series of “limited editions” – Each bottle is one of no more than 300 drawn from a single cask and each is hand-numbered and carries the number of the cask in which it matured. Dr Andrew Forrester, UK Brand Ambassador says: “As no two casks will ever produce the same whisky and there are no more than 300 bottles from any single cask, every batch of The Balvenie Single Barrel First Fill will have a unique identity. Due to the experience David Stewart has from over 50 years at The Balvenie however, we can expect a consistent character to this dram and boy, it is a good one”.TASTING NOTESNOSEBounty of sweet oak and spice.TASTERich and complex with deep vanilla oakiness.

In 1848, Queen Victoria selected Balmoral Castle as her holiday residence. Only three days after she had arrived, the distillery manager John Begg made an invitation to Prince Albert to visit his distillery, knowing he was interested in all things mechanical. To his surprise, Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and their three eldest children visited the next day. The rest, as the saying goes, is history. So impressed were they with the whisky, John Begg immediately received a Royal Warrant of Appointment as supplier to the Queen.The Royal connection has meant that the distillery has played host to a string of famous visitors, many of them British prime ministers taking an hour or so off between meetings with the monarch of the day at Balmoral.The history of the distillery nearly ran a very different course. The first licensed Lochnagar distillery was set up on the north side of the river in 1826 by a former illicit distiller – but it was soon burned down by fellow smugglers who were not impressed by a rival deciding to abide by the law! It was then rebuilt by Begg in 1845 on the south bank of the river – and he renamed it New Lochnagar. The north-bank distillery closed by 1860 and Lochnagar continued to prosper – although the Abergeldie Estates refused to sell the distillery the grounds it occupied, seeing the value increase as the distillery flourished and expanded.Royal Lochnagar is one of the smallest distilleries in The Classic Malts Selection™, and has been rebuilt three times. However, it still retains the traditional distillery appearance – with its two pagoda kiln heads – and techniques (including an open mash tun) and also has a visitor centre and a ‘learning centre’ for the appreciation of malt whisky.ROYAL LOCHNAGAR 12 YEAR OLDRoyal Lochnagar 12 year old is a fragrant Highland single malt with a delightful balance of fruit and spices.STRENGTH 40% ABVAPPEARANCE Pale amber.NOSE Not obvious to begin with.

Apart from a break in the 1920’s and 1930’s whisky has been produced steadily until 1983 when production ceased briefly. In 1985, the future looked bleak when the distillery’s owners, Invergordon, were taken over by Whyte and Mackay who chose to focus efforts on their flagship single malts, Dalmore and Isle of Jura at the expense of Bruichladdich. Thankfully the distillery’s future is brighter since its purchase by the whisky independent Murray McDavid in December 2000. Jim McEwan and his team have breathed life back into the place, with Islay’s first bottling hall also now installed. The whisky produced by Bruichladdich was traditionally one of the least peaty of the Islay malts, although ironically it is rated as the islanders’ favourite. In the future we will see different whiskies from these stills: the traditional unpeated, the 40ppm Port Charlotte, the monstrous 82ppm Octomore, a triple- and even quadruple-distilled spirit, an organic spirit…the list goes on.Apart from bottling on the island using Islay water, the Laddie team are also active finishers of whisky, choosing to transfer spirit into casks that have been freshly empited of various wines and fortified wines. They term this Additional Cask Enhancement.Nose: Opening with assertive waves of peat smoke and Atlantic squall, the olfactory system is on high alert in anticipation of some major sensory excitement. A swell of aromatics flood the senses with notes of iodine, salty canvas, crushed sea shells, charred oak staves, black pepper, paprika and leather tobacco pouches. The second wave brings vanilla, figs and soft plump dates, marinated pear, freshly milled malt, dark sweet toffee and cracked walnuts. It’s smoky. It’s smouldering. It’s sensuous. Just close your eyes and inhale long and deep. This is aromatic awesomeness.Palate: Wow! Waves of the sweetest, smoothest, warmest smokiest spirit that you have ever experienced flood onto the palate like the atlantic surf on Saligo Bay. It is potent, focused and the flavours explode brilliantly onto the palate. Full of depth and complexity, the smokey sweetness of the barley contrasts beautifully with the marine freshness of the spirit and the richness of toffee and vanilla. The complexity is enhanced further with a citrus twist and then mellow oak tempers the fire. Once the taste buds adjust to what is happening, they rejoice in the company and pleasure of this young Celt.Finish: It’s long and heart-warming, arousing feelings of pride and passion.

A multitude of flavours on the nose, smoked ham, spice, fruitcake, wood, ginger and a touch of butter. Complex palate with layers of smoke, nut and wood.This 18 Year Old expression of Laphroaig is made in limited quantities each year and savoured by a fortunate few. A soft, sweet and spicy Islay peat smoke greets you when you first open the bottle. The immediate taste is an oak sweetness, from 18 years in the barrel. A faint hint of the sea can be detected, testimony to its time maturing on the remote island of Islay.It is bottled at 48% ABV and is non-chill filtered for a depth of taste and texture.Official tasting notes:COLOUR : Bright GoldNOSE: At bottling strength, a soft toffee sweet but faintly spicy flavour counterbalances the trace of delicate phenols and fruit. An all encompassing smoothness brings these together. A touch of water allows the seaweed and salt to come through but not enough to overpower the vanilla and honey sweetness with just a trace of new mown hay and peat at the finish.BODY: An intense depth that is exceptionally balanced and warming.PALATE: An instant warming tang of smoke fades into smooth floral scents, which blends seamlessly into an oaky nuttiness and leaves a lasting sweetness on the taste. With a touch of water, the peaty warmth fills the mouth but does not overshadow the sweet chocolate smoothness. This is balanced by the rich toffee taste and slowly fades into a delicate hint of heather and peat smoke.FINISH: Full bodied, long with a luxurious oily smoothness.","Sampled during our recent visit to Laphroaig Distillery (April 2014), this is one of their standard expressions made in limited batches each year.My tasting notes:Appearance: Light yellow, full refractive goldNose: Sweet honey & peanut satay, peat, slightly hoppy, fruity apples, pears (pear drops), apricot, sandalwoodTaste: Sweet sandalwood, hazelnut &  gingerbread, vanilla rice pudding with a little apple and pear puree, seaweed and clean and clinical iodineFinish: Long sweet honeyed vanilla and burnt sandalwood incense sticks", £81.64

With just a splash of chilled water, this blend of soft, sweet grain whiskies and elegant, refined malt whiskies epitomises “deliciousness” in the world of  Scotch whisky.The Secret is in the OakThe secret to making Asyla is the quality of the casks. We use only whiskies aged in first-fill American oak casks because these yield whiskies with more vanilla character, more richness and more sweetness than refill casks. Asyla is made with 50% malt whisky. There are few blended Scotches that use as high a malt content as we do at Compass Box. The result is a carefully crafted, elegant blended Scotch whisky that makes the perfect aperitif.The Signature Range from Compass BoxAsyla is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty- smoky character of The Peat Monster and the elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from the highest quality casks, to create more complexity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, flavour integration and soft mouthfeel. Extra steps, but we think they’re worth it.Flavour Descriptors Sweet, delicate and very smooth on the palate, with flavours of vanilla-cream, cereals and a subtle apple- like fruit character.Recommendations Ideal as an aperitif served in a white wine or similar glass with chilled water to taste.

Most whisky in Hedonism has been aged in first-fill American oak casks. This ageing yields a very special whisky that is full and round with richly textured flavours of vanilla and toffee.Rare, Old Scotch Grain WhiskyHedonism is unusual in the Scotch whisky world: a blended grain Scotch whisky. It is very rare to see 100% grain whisky bottlings, in Scotland. Going back 100 years, grain whisky brands were more common, but they were overtaken in popularity by the big brands of blended Scotch, which comprised both grain whisky and malt whisky. Today, most Scotch grain whisky gets blended into the big brand names, typically at young ages. For Hedonism, we search for old casks of Scotch grain whisky. And we only produce Hedonism once a year, when we find casks with the right flavour profile.Rich, Sweet, AlluringWhen good Scotch grain whisky is aged in good quality American oak casks, the results can be stunning: a rich, sweet, alluring whisky, redolent of vanilla, pastry cream and coconut. You’ll find all these things in our Hedonism bottlings. We believe that great Scotch grain whisky is the little-known treasure of the Scotch whisky industry.The Signature Range from Compass BoxHedonism is part of the Signature Range from Compass Box. The five Scotch whiskies in this range cover the entire spectrum of Scotch whisky styles, from the delicate, sweet character of Asyla, to the subtle vanilla, clove and fruity characteristics of Oak Cross, the rich and spice notes of The Spice Tree, the peaty- smoky character of The Peat Monster and the elegant flavours of vanilla cream, toffee and coconut in Hedonism. Each is made from the highest quality casks, to create more complexity. The whiskies are combined according to each recipe and returned to casks for marrying up to 24 months before bottling. Steps like these enhance complexity, flavour integration and soft mouthfeel.

Bottled at 46%, “The Peat Monster” combines extremely smoky malt whisky from Islay with medium-peated Highland whiskies to create a balanced and approachable monster, but a monster nonetheless. Enjoy!Complex and Multi-layeredA whisky for lovers of complex, multi-layered peaty whiskies. What makes it fit perfectly into the Compass Box house style is the balance of richness and subtle sweetness that the casks of Speyside malt provide to the smoky- peaty Islay and island malts. This is the great benefit of combining single malts from different distilleries; we are not limited to the produce of one distillery. Like a winemaker blending grape varieties, we can create layers of complexity. For recent batches, we have introduced even more complexity by adding some south shore Islay malt and island malt to enhance the peatiness and earthiness.

Due to the fluctuation in availability Gregg explained that as a company they had taken the decision to start buying and maturing New Make from various (~5) distilleries and maturing them in 1st fill Buffalo Trace Bourbon Barrels. Buffalo Trace barrels give the best results as they have one of the best cooperage’s and the barrel to variation is minimal – giving consistent maturation results.

We source this oak from a mill in the Vosges which produces some of the highest quality cooperage oak for winemakers. The result is a big malt whisky of richness and spice-like complexity.The Second Coming.First launched in 2005, we were forced to discontinue production under a legal threat by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) for our pioneering use of the highest quality French oak inner staves. This, despite rave reviews from consumers, trade and press. We agreed to disagree with the SWA and halted production (for the full story, see http://www.compassboxwhisky.com).Over the following three years we developed a new maturation process which yielded similar if not superior results to our previous method, and this new process is something the SWA can’t take any issue with. The Spice Tree was then relaunched in September 2009. The Whisky & The Method. As in the past, The Spice Tree is made from 100% malt whisky sourced from northern Highland distilleries, (notably and primarily malt whisky distilled in the village of Brora). The primary maturation is in a mix of first-fill and refill American oak.What is different is the secondary maturation. Rather than using inner stave inserts, as we did for the original Spice Tree, we rack the whisky into barrels with heavily toasted new French oak heads. We have created a method for getting a super heavy toast on the cask heads which imparts a flavour profile similar to the flat staves used for the original Spice Tree.1 We use oak with three different levels of toasting on the barrel heads, thus allowing us to blend the resultant whiskies to create additional layers of complexity. This secondary maturation lasts as long as two years.The Spice Tree is a very rich whisky, suitable for after-dinner sipping, as an accompaniment to certain cheeses and, especially, in cocktails.Flavour DescriptorsBig, sweet aromas of clove, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.

The Super Tuscan region originated in the 1970’s when the Domaine Origine Contollee (D.O.C.) for the Chianti region in Tuscany restricted Chianti production to specific grape varietals. Perhaps as an aftermath of phyloxera or just experimentation by viticulturists a lot of the region had adopted classic French grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot onto their vineyards and subsequent use of these grapes ruled them out of the Chianti D.O.C. Thus they dropped the age-old name and struck out to produce the new Super Tuscan wines, in time earning recognition and now becoming household names with wines such as Sassicaia.

These latest offerings from Edradour distillery represent a move away from the Straight from the Cask series which have been excellent over the last few years. Dilution down to 46% however has been uncompromised by refusing to chill-filter and so the whisky retains all that lovely wine-y goodness from the cask.

That is exactly what we are doing with Great King Street.Five key things set apart our approach to making ‘Great King Street‘ from any other Blended Scotch Whisky brand.1. Great Grain. First, we start with the very highest quality single grain Scotch whiskies. Grain whiskies are the foundation of good Blended Scotch. We source ours from a renowned Lowland distillery and all of it is aged in ‘first fill’ American oak barrels, which makes the grain whisky much richer and sweeter on the palate than those aged in larger, refill casks.2. More Malt. Secondly, we use a higher proportion of malt whisky than most other Blends. For instance, ‘The Artist’s Blend‘ consists of over 50% malt whisky, far more than the 30 or 40% most blends use. This provides more character and complexity.3. Better Oak. At Compass Box we are known for our fanaticism about quality oak casks. Every cask of whisky used to make ‘Great King Street‘ is of a much higher quality than is typical in Scotch whisky: first-fill American oak casks, first-fill European oak ex-Sherry butts and, something no other Blended Scotch uses, new oak. For our ‘Artist’s Blend‘, we use new, heavily-toasted French oak.4. Bottled Naturally.‘Great King Street‘ is bottled at its natural colour (no E150 colouring agent added at all!) and without the chill filtration prior to bottling that most Scotch whiskies go through. This leaves the whisky full of its natural complexity and mouthfeel.5. Traditional Strength. We bottle ‘Artist’s Blend’ at 43% alcohol by volume, a strength traditionally used in Scotland many years ago.

Miles and miles of peat bog in the west of the island provide the raw material whose influence so characterises the south eastern Islay malts, of which Lagavulin™ is perhaps best known. The rich peaty water of Lagavulin runs down the brown burn to the distillery from the Solan Lochs in the hills above the distillery.There’s nothing rushed about Islay, nor is there about Lagavulin™; before being bottled, the malt spends sixteen unhurried years maturing in oak casks, the longest maturation period for any of the Classic Malts offerings.Long fermentation, long distillation and long maturation together ensure that Lagavulin develops all of its long, rich, peaty character. It’s is a spirit that likes to take its time.

The presumption is that JW Black Label derives its slightly odd earthy peatiness from Lagavulin. I suspect that if there is Lagavulin in JW Black Label then there is at least an equal amount of Caol Ila if not more! Bear in mind Lagavulin produced only 2.45 million litres of alcohol per annum compared to Caol Ila’s mighty 6.5 million, plus add in the premium price and huge reputation and following Lagavulin has. These minor details would suggest that more Lagavulin should end up as Single Malt bottlings in the Duty Free shop, or even shipped directly to the U.S. where it is hugely popular.

A little may find its way into JW Black Label also. Cardhu distillery is the spiritual home of Johnnie Walker and the 3rd distillery we ever visited. Cardhu is infamous in Spain and were it not in Scotland would probably be declared Spain’s home single malt. As a result of the few percent distillate each year that isn’t blended being shipped directly to Spain, Cardhu was little known as a single malt in the UK up until fairly recently. Cardhu distillery also caused a little controversy by meeting demand with bottlings labelled ‘Pure Malt’ implying it had been mixed with malt from other distilleries. Later this was switched to ‘Single Malt’ though perhaps with little difference in flavour, sparking huge debate over the labelling and provenance of Single Malts.

Surprisingly good and very affordable, within this blend much had been done to preserve those beneficial elements from the sherry including deep fruitiness, chocolate and nutty characters. This is achieved easily whilst avoiding the overly tannic leathery and sulphuric/rubbery elements. Of note I recently learned that sherry casks are often treated by burning sulphur candles inside them after use (or conditioning*) to prevent mold and bacterial growth spoiling them when they are shipped dry(ish) to be used in the whisky industry. *The majority of sherry casks used in the whisky industry these days are not ex-sherry maturation casks, but casks specially made and conditioned by filling with sherry for a short period of time. Traditionally sherry shipping casks would have been transported full, gladly emptied of their contents by happy imbibers here in the UK and then re-used for whisky. Due to demand for casks and as most sherry is bottled at source before shipping these day. ‘conditioned’ casks may stand/ship for reasonable periods of time empty, during which they are subject to contamination due to the rich sugary residue inside the oak cask. Fumigation with sulphur candles appears not to be an issue for wine and sherry production; where the norm is to refill the cask immediately anyway  – bypassing the need for fumigation. Whisky however penetrates deep into the wooden cask for a prolonged period of time, and appears to be excellent at extracting the sulphuric notes indicative of a poor sherry cask management.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Blends Tagged as: 84 points, Blended malt whisky, Bronze, NAS, Sherry matured whisky, The Feathery, The Spencerfield Spirit Company ",£45

Light gold in appearance, it has an intense, thick and oily smoke structure on the nose which reveals a sharper, more medicinal phenolic layer with a piercing burst of fruity ripe peaches and just a touch of oak. It has an ashy taste, with slight apple-core bitterness and notes of leather and spicy vanilla lingering at the back, accompanied by sharper notes of pink grapefruit and ripe orchard fruits. A long, elegant finish brings a kaleidoscope of spicy and peaty notes that die out with a juicy burst and a loud call for another sip.The new whisky’s traditional yet contemporary packaging retains the striking dark green glass bottle of the first peated releases but this time features a traditional ‘cutter’ peat tool emblazoned in silver on the pack’s distinctive black label and tube design.anCnoc Assistant Brand Manager Stephanie Bridge commented: ‘Given the popularity of anCnoc as a contemporary, easy drinking malt whisky, we are thrilled with the reception our new dark, peaty side has had amongst drinkers since we launched the collection back in April this year. We wanted anCnoc’s peated malts to find their way to the many people out there who love whisky but think that peat is not for them, and initial feedback shows that we are starting to build the appeal of a peated dram amongst our drinkers which is good news. We are delighted to have Cutter join this exquisite collection, bringing a slightly smokier, stronger peated option that has all the quality, character and taste that every whisky made at Knockdhu distillery enjoys. The 1st September is now officially anCnoc Peaty day and a date to put in the diaries of whisky fans in years to come.’2000 cases of anCnoc ‘Cutter’will be available online and in specialist and independent UK whisky retailers from 1st September, rrp£52.

The barley is malted using peat from the St Fergus peat bog at Blackhills on the Aberdeenshire coast. Working hard to obtain as much spirit as they can, the staff at Knockdhu distillery have braved the harsher peated malt, notorious for yielding much less alcohol per tonne of malted barley and producing noxious (more phenolic) by-products. They have attempted to achieve a reproducibility in their distillation and targeted the Croesol (2-Methoxyphenol) type phenolic compounds delivering that medicinal iodine and smoky wood rather than the Guaiacol-like compounds more associated with smoky spicy meaty flavours. The resultant peaty influence has an almost menthol-like quality which incorporates well with the light fruity AnCnoc spirit and their dedication to Bourbon cask maturation.Appearance:Light/pale gold (apparently – it was a little too dark to see!)Nose:Damp moss and wet peat bog, floral violets, citrus lemon and lime foam, sweet oil-seed rape honeyTaste:Smokey medicinal peat, iodine, Elastoplast and TCP vapours, parma violet sweeties with a little rose water sugar syrup, some cinnamon spiceFinish:Long, cleansing (antiseptic?) citrus fruits, mildly spiced and ashen peat (like a spent brushwood campfire early the following morning)",null

A very interesting dram all the same but I have been finding any Marsala cask finish whisky slightly unsavoury. Strange because I think my issue is the slightly savoury nature it imparts – it pretends to be umami and meaty but ends up like olives or nut loaf (it just isnae meat). There was a huge complexity to this dram and it really took me to the fairground with the diesel engined rides and candy floss and popcorn stalls overwhelming my nose. On tasting though, I felt like I fell out of the fairground and into the sea and came out with a green olive in my popcorn and seaweed on my toffee apple… Redeems itself on the finish but by then the damage was done.

In fact I suspect most of the peat normally in Bunnahabhain expressions arises from the water source used rather than introduced when drying the malted barley.

I still prefer the traditional ‘un-peated’ style of Bunnahabhain which they do so well, however this captures the essence of that and incorporates a healthy dose of peat smoke too. Rather than overpowering it feels more like drinking standard Bunna at a barbecue on an Islay beach bonfire with a cigar… nom nom nom… I would definitely recommend anyone try a peated Bunna (either the Toiteach official bottling or Indie bottlings like this one from Signatory) just to taste the difference.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Bunnahabhain Tagged as: 16 years old, 1997 vintage, 84 points, Bunnahabhain, Bunnahabhain 16 Years Old 1997, Bunnahabhain 16 Years Old 1997 Heavily Peated #5512 ~ 50.3% (Signatory), Islay single malt scotch whisky, Peated Bunnahabhain, Scotch, Signatory, Signatory Cask Strength, Single malt, Uncategorized, Whisky ",null

Currently Aberfeldy are going through a lot of revamp and rebranding including major alterations to their distillery to install a biomass generator, making their malt more environmentally friendly. Abefeldy Distillery (or Dewar’s World of Whisky) is well worth a visit and even more so now after their recent renovations to the visitor centre. We recently popped back up for a visit and a very detailed and educational whisky geek tour (as part of the May 2014 whisky month celebrations).

While I enjoyed sampling this, I wasn’t really blown away by it. The sherry and smoke influences I have heard others describe in this dram didn’t really make an appearance to me. Sadly it is so silky and smooth it is almost forgettable. While that is an achievement in itself, I prefer drams that make their presence felt with a much bigger impact than this. Incredibly refined it is a pleasure to dram but again I find myself lacking the willpower to commit to wanting a whole bottle.

Thankfully I selected the former category and managed to get hold of a small number of samples from Port Dundas. Port Dundas on the outskirts of Glasgow used to produce just under 40 million litres of alcohol as part of the Diageo portfolio. The majority went to blends such as Johnnie Walker, J&B’s, Bells, Haig, Vat 69, Black & White and White Horse. Diageo shifted production of all its Grain whisky to Cameronbridge and  North British Distilleries, and Port Dundas was closed in 2010.This particular example was distilled in 1992 and has spent 21 years maturing in a refill ex-bourbon hogshead and bottled at cask strength by Douglas Laing as part of their Clan Denny aged Grain Whisky portfolioColour:Straw Gold with medium tearsNose:Banana, vanilla cream, foamy banana milkshake, coconut milk, cereal, fruit; apple, peach. orange, honey, lemon meringue pie and hints of bourbonTaste:Warming, thin but oily, spicy pepper, ginger and cinnamon and orange zest, cereal grains; wheat perhaps, banana, coconut, lemongrass, vanilla cream and milkFinish:Spiced, prickly, slightly drying but a small component of mouth-coating sweetness too, a little paradoxical and of medium lengthWould I buy it:Possibly not, this is one of the finest Scottish Grain Whiskies I have tasted but I am not sure I would want a whole bottle of this. Complex and interesting but a little spicy and thin and lacking in body and character that single malts bring. A multitude of vanilla, banana and coconut cream and even some almost direct from the cask Bourbon flavours in this reveal the true nature of its age – just leaves you with little to really chew on and get your teeth into… Still, to taste a piece of history was priceless and I would recommend anyone to try it, a beautiful addition to the Clan Denny range for sure. Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Grain Tagged as: 1992 vintage, 21 Years Old, 78 points, Clan Denny, Hunter Hamilton, Port Dundas, Port Dundas 21 Years Old 1992, Port Dundas Distillery, Single Grain Whisky ",null

Too busy being distracted by the beautiful distillery and its surroundings during our whistle-stop tour. To make up for lack of tasting time (though to be fair we were provided with a dram of Uigeadail with lunch plus a dram of Galileo & Blasda after the tour) we were provisioned with 3 bottles of single cask samples all of the same ABV and Age (both of which I am wildly guessing at as I really can’t remember the exact details) however I am very sure they were each matured in either Bourbon, French Oak or Sherry casks; representative of the building blocks of both the Uigeadail [Bourbon + Sherry cask] or Corryvreckan [Bourbon + French Oak cask] expressions.

The kind of things you simply can’t find anywhere else – especially not in a high street chain.It’s with this ethos in mind that Isle of Jura have named their new series ‘Boutique Barrels’.  The idea was to create a range of very special single malts for whisky enthusiasts, making bespoke single cask bottlings available to consumers without the fuss of fancy packaging to distract from the spirit (a laudable goal if ever there was one).  At the same time, the range gives the distillery the opportunity to show off what their spirit is capable, by making available some of its more special casks, hand-picked over a period of five years by the Master Distiller.The Isle of Jura Boutique Barrels are all vintage single cask bottlings (rare enough in itself for this distillery), and have been bottled at full strength without chill-filtration – in short, the goal has been to preserve the natural elements of the spirit for whisky aficionados and connoisseurs to appreciate.The initial selection for the Boutique Barrels range is a trio of single casks from different vintages and maturation styles.This Jura 1993 is part of the distillery’s ‘Boutique Barrels’ series of single casks, bottled at full cask strength. This ‘Sherry Ji’ edition has been finished in Oloroso sherry butts.• A sensual delight• A subtle array of flavours; warm deeply mature and inviting• A mouth-watering collection of flavours that only an island and a unique Oloroso Sherry cask can bring• Rich citrus marmalade, crushed almonds, spicy ginger and roasted coffeeTHE CASK• Drawn from the richness of the finest cask to complete this masterpiece• Matured in American white oak from 1993 until 2002 at the Jura distillery• Re-racked in 2002 into Oloroso Pasada Sherry Butts from Gonzalez Byass in Spain – which nurtured and tamed this island malt to perfection",":An interesting Jura expression, purchased because you don’t often come across unusually matured Jura (well no more so than there ambiguous core range and travel exclusives). A distillery that seems to have embraced NAS a long time before it was contentious, and even before it was new and cool. Jura were producing expressions that either gave no age statement or were constructed from mixed aged whiskies – their range was much more based around hitting very different flavour profiles. For their boutique barrel range they seem to have come back to the mainstream wisdom by releasing specific year vintages finished in well-defined casks. I had to go for the Sherry option, there really wasn’t a choice! I find Jura very drinkable in most of their expressions and I love Sherry matured/finished whiskies too. Here’s what we thought…Colour:Blood orange rubyNose:Leather, lots of leather and tinges of rubber typical of sherry maturation, toffee, some fruity elements and cocoa or sweetened coffee (Latte or something similar)Taste:Warming, smooth, fruity, new and old leather, cocoa and chocolate, nutty almond, hazelnut, plum, fig and prunesFinish:Medium/long, sweet, fruity and earthyWould I buy it:Hell yes! This is simply delicious, a stunning Jura expression, I was worried about the more than faint rubbery hints on the nose – often evidence that the sherry cask has added sulphuric notes back into the whisky which can be overwhelmingly acrid and distasteful. Not on this occasion however the palate serves up a smorgasbord of flavours I just love and which compliment each other immensely.

The mind bog-gling answer is “yes”! By taming our usual mighty peating levels we created Blasda, peated to an average of just 8 parts per million phenol (8ppm) compared to the more usual 24ppm. Blasda is still perfectly balanced, but light, sweet and delicious.AromaDeliciously sweet and refreshing. On first nosing, the aroma is reminiscent of baked banoffie pie and roast chestnuts. On further nosing, cloves, pine cones and fresh mint rise from the glass, softened by creamy vanilla custard. A tingle of lemon and lime marmalade cuts through the vanilla with spiced pears followed by a breath of menthol and sea salt. Deep ripe fruits fuse with almond and vanilla.With water, the sweet effervescence of sherbet vanilla and chocolate limes burst from the liquid. A bouquet of scented violet, narcissus and chrysanthemum bring a sparkling ethereal fragrance. Cured ham with a dusting of white pepper and cinnamon is served with gentle smoked fish and green peppers, with a sprig of leafy mint on top.TasteRefreshing, silky and creamy to the palate, the initial sip is sweet with a mixture of sugared almonds, marzipan and hints of dried fruits. Gentle peat oils well up on the palate, remaining soft, clean and dry with a dusting of powdery parma violets. Tangy lemon juice and orange rind freshen the palate with a gentle fizz. Later tingling spices and creamy cappuccino bring a gentle warmth.FinishThe finish is medium in length and tingly with a refreshing balance of chrysanthemum tea, clean lemon zest, creamy vanilla and hints of cinnamon spiced apple.",":During our recent society trip to Islay we of course stopped by Ardbeg distillery for lunch and a wee tour culminating in collecting a whole bunch of Ardbeg samples which due to time constraints we had to load onto the bus as we sped on to Laphroaig.

Not particularly impressive I likened this to the Caol Ila Stitchell Reserve in that it seems to be lacking something (peat!) and in so doing reveals a whole host of jarring, unappealing flavours that didn’t float my boat.

Perhaps it was the strength of this expression masking much and leaving me with this mix-around. Normally I like my Mortlach’s so sherried the mint is difficult to spot. Indie bottling like this must surely give the new Mortlach range a run for their money, however Adelphi’s selection (being single cask bottlings) reveal a variety of characters and are unlikely to satisfy the continuity of flavours that the official bottlings must achieve.

Mixed Walnut and Pecan.Finish – Smooth fruit salad which lingers on the palate.",":Heralded  in our whiskileaks post here: Tomatin release new 14 Year Old Port Wood Finish and 1989 Vintage; this 14 year old Port Wood finish expression has joined the core Tomatin range and replaced the wholly Bourbon-matured 15 year old. I was a little sad to see the 15 go; I found it hard to choose between the Sherry influenced nutty chocolate bombshell of the Tomatin 18 and the Tropical fruits of the 15 yo. Unfortunately Tomatin have come to the conclusion the 15 yo wasn’t hitting the market requirements and so out came the 14 yo Port finish. How we happened by a sample of this was through both luck and gratitude. One of the many reasons (as if you need any!) to follow The Whiskyphiles through social media such as our Facebook or Twitter  accounts is that we advertise and pass on details of any whisky or whisky-related competitions we discover. Following the launch of the Tomatin 14, Tomatin ran a Facebook competition asking who you would share a samples with. Luckily a good friend of ours (and President of the Edinburgh University Water of Life Society) was selected as a winner; and so I found myself in possession of a 5cl bottle, graciously shared with us. (p.s. it is not manadatory should you win any of these competitions that you repay us in kindness – though we do love free whisky; it is our most favourite category of whisky!). So here’s what we thought.Colour:Coppery gold with a rosé blushNose:Sweet nougat/confectionary, tropical fruits; papaya, mango, pineapple, honey, a little malted barley, jammy blackcurrants and candy floss (like a good old-fashioned sweet shop overall)Taste:Very sweet palate, reminiscent of plum duff (plum pudding), brown sugar, nutmeg spice and more fruity sweet cherries and plum influence from the port finishingFinish:Medium long, sweet with cereal and wood influencesWould I buy it:Our overall opinion of this was a saccharine sweet confectionary of a dram which was highly drinkable. A definite summer whisky, this one was almost too sweet for my palate but I would expect it to pair well with savoury items usually paired with port such as a good strong blue cheese (e.g. Stilton) or one of my absolute favourite cheeses Morbier. I still miss the 15yo and think that I actually prefer that to this although there are some common elements in both, the port finish on this seems like a tactic to sweeten the whisky and release it a year younger, in the process this lacks the real fruit punch the 15yo gave out. Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Tomatin Tagged as: 14 Years Old, 80 points, Highland single malt scotch whisky, OB, Scotch, Single malt, Single Malt - Tomatin, Tomatin, Tomatin 14 Year Old Port Wood Finish (Official Bottling), Tomatin Distillery, Whisky ",£48.95

I seem a little at odds with the fact that I scored this at 86 yet the Carribean cask we tried only mustered 71 – perhaps a lot is to be said about locale/environment and others in the tasting lineup to affect our relative experiences. For me this is delicious and has exotic ripe banana and rum stamped all over it, the Carribean cask I felt was a little disjointed (like whisky and rum mixed). I was a little disappointed to learn that the ‘Cuban rum casks’ are actually ex-bourbon casks that have imported rum put into them for a while to season them (in the exotic locale of Speyside) then the rum is tossed (yup – that’s right, down the drain it goes) for the “rum” barrel to then be used to finish the whisky. I guess in all of this process there is a lot of room for variation; the rum, the casks, the time for rum-seasoning and finally the time for whisky finishing with the only controlling process coming from the Balvenie Malt Master David Stewart himself overseeing this process. The Cuban expression however deserves it’s slightly exclusive status as it was discovered to be un-saleable in the US due to their foreign policy/embargo (el bloqueo) on Cuban products. Having drawn attention to this, Balvenie then had to go to great lengths subsequently to prove non of their rum imported to Speyside had come from Cuba when making the Golden or Carribean Cask expressions.

Perfect for the gastronome or those with healthy appetites. The name presumably was selected based upon the majority of flavours in this expression having some link to Normandy such as apple or pear Normandy tart usually a frangipane/almond flour pasty filled with the fruit so abundant in this region.

The end result is a Single Malt full of charm, complexity and quality.Tasting NotesColour: Burnished CopperAroma: Poached pears and honey followed by toasted almonds and a subtle touch of cranberry. With water a coffee note appears together with chocolate orange and mellow butterscotch.Palate: Dark chocolate, cherry and Turkish delights are evident as are stewed fruits and toffee. Muscular notes of dark plum wrestle with bitter-sweet apricots and a hint of cinnamon.Finish: A well-balanced combination of the finesse of The Arran Malt and the restrained fruit and oak from the Amarone casks. Concentrated and elegant this malt delivers on all levels.",":This is the Amarone cask finished expression from the Isle of Arran Distillery. Opened in 1995, the team at Arran Distillery set about experimenting with numerous cask finishes for their whisky before finally settling on a core range that really complimented their spirit. This particular example has been finished in Amarone casks. Amarone (or Amarone della Valpolicella in full) is a rich dry Itialian red wine made from Corvina, Rondinella and other approved grape varieties. The name Amarone, in Italian, literally means “the Great Bitter”; this was originally to distinguish it from the Recioto produced in the same region, which is sweeter in taste.Colour:Ruby AmberNose:Almond paste (like out of a freshly baked almond croissant), sweet fruity strawberry and blackberry jam, putty/linseed oil, toasted almondsTaste:On the palate this was a little less sweeter than the nose would suggest, cinnamon spice, fruity but slightly odd combination of oranges and strawberries, toffee, (pickled?) ginger and newly polished woodFinish:Drying, sweet and fruity with more subtle spices, medium/longWould I buy it:In short, Yes! I had a very reasonably sized sample of this whisky and even that wasn’t enough, this stuff is delicious. At under £40 a bottle and bottled at 50% ABV you get a lot for your money.

Of these I have tried the Glenglassaugh and was of the impression it was equally as good as this Glengoyne 25 Year Old. In the end I decided I would need £1250 to buy them all!In actuality, no I am unlikely ever to buy a whisky at £250 a bottle, however if like me you have an affinity for Glengoyne, love sherried whiskies or old woody whiskies and do have that kind of money to spend – then I don’t think you would be disappointed with this 25 year old expression.

Moscatel (or Muscat) is an off-dry sweet and fortified white wine, and its cask impart a sweet and fruity character to the peaty Caol Ila whisky. This was tasted in the warehouse tasting room at Caol Ila Distillery.My tasting notes:Appearance: Full refractive gold (10/20),Nose: Sweet, putty/plasticine/elastoplasts, a little smoke but fights at first with a heavy syrupy fruity aroma before combining into roasted almonds, sugary marzipan and amarretti biscuits (Amaretti di Saronno)Taste: Sweet, a little oily before a fizzy orange/lemon zestiness bursts forth, the fruitiness subsides into that characteristic cigarette ash peat so distinctive of Caol Ila, the sugary sweetness lingersFinish: Long and vaporous, this fumigates the mouth with peaty smoke, however sweet fruity notes and more marzipan remain, to be discovered", £45

Perfect for enjoying at any time.Colour: Pale lemony goldAroma: The scent of citrus and ripening peaches is softened by the aroma of vanilla.Taste: First, vanilla is detected on the tongue before it ripples along the palate bringing a burst of flowery fruitiness.Finish: About a minute after tasting, you are left with a clean and salving aftertaste with hints of orange and peach.",":We have previously bought and finished a bottle of Glenmorangie’s 10 Year Old (sixteen men of Tain version) long before we started the blog. I received this 10cl as part of the Pioneering Collection – perfect for trying out this the base 10 year old and the subsequent finished 12 year olds in Sauternes, Sherry or Port casks.Colour:Full goldNose:Lemony citrus, grassy, sweet honey, heather, malted cereal barley and butterscotchTaste:Silky, toffee, sweet honey, juicy fruits dominate such as tangerine and pear, cereal and vanillaFinish:Sweet and smooth, honey and fruits with a little ginger and pink grapefruitWould I buy it againYes, I have developed a real respect for the 10 year old from Glenmorangie. It is incredibly smooth and drinkable. It is enjoyably not too sweet or challenging. Heather honey and fruits dominate in what is quite a subtly complicated whisky.

The only historical link comes from the fact that the town in Fife was built on land owned by the earl of Rothes, and so the Fife town had the prefix ‘Glen’ added to it to avoid confusion with the town of Rothes in Moray.

Using only malted barley, we then slowly distil our whisky in tall, swan-necked copper stills, exact replicas of those first used all those generations ago. Finally this classic Speyside malt is matured in oak casks previously used for Bourbon or Sherry that imbues it with a creamy, more balanced sweetness and rich fruit flavours. The result?

Grant after the founder John Duff bankrupted himself during the construction of the neighbouring Benriach distillery (known contemporaneously as ‘Longmorn II’).  Longmorn-Glenlivet Distillers merged with Glenlivet and Glen Grant in 1970 before the Seagram takeover in 1978.As soon as the dust had settled on Pernod’s takeover of Chivas Brothers, following the joint acquisition with Diageo of the Seagram empire, insiders were predicting a facelift and increased marketing spend on Longmorn, and in 2007 this came to pass.  The much-admired, simply packaged 15yo has been replaced by a new 16yo in a fancy bottle with a sustained marketing push.  As ever, sadly, this new image came at a price, with the new 16yo being launched at nearly twice the price of the old 15yo.  Independent bottlings of Longmorn are relatively common and frequently outstanding in quality and value (the distillery has a long relationship with independent bottlers Gordon & Macphail of Elgin).  The house style of Longmorn is rich and sherried, frequently with pronounced hints of grapefruit.  The spirit is able to withstand long ageing, producing some outstanding older bottlings.What we say:At a recent visit to the Whiski rooms for lunch I tried the Lochside 1991, 13 Year Old – Connoisseurs Choice (Gordon and MacPhail) for dessert, Paula however opted for the distillery own bottling (OB) from Longmorn, rapidly becoming her favourite distillery.Colour:Amber blush goldNose:Blossom, honeysuckle, cherry blossom, flower bouquets, fruity honey, oranges and tannic suede leatherTaste:Smooth with an initial cayenne pepper spice, thick and syrupy in the mouth this has fragrant jasmine tea, buttery cookie dough, sugary sweet with a likening to Haribo’s tangfastic or fizzy fishFinish:Long, oily with tropical fruits such as lychee and guavaWould we buy it again:I think this OB has firmly cemented Paula’s love of Longmorn, though this lacks a little of that rose and lemon / Turkish delight there is still a lot of floral fruitiness in this expression that she really enjoyed. For me I do appreciate it even though the flavour profile is way off my taste preferences, Longmorn always seem quite complex but packed full of hugely diverse and interesting flavours that somehow come together as a whole.  A little like shoving a  handful of different sweeties into your mouth and buzzing off the sugar rush and end result… taste the rainbow!Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Longmorn Tagged as: 16 years old, 86 points, Longmorn, Longmorn 16 Year Old, Longmorn Distillery, OB, Single malt Scotch, Speyside single malt scotch whisky, The Whiski Rooms Edinburgh, Whisky ",":At a recent visit to the Whiski rooms for lunch I tried the Lochside 1991, 13 Year Old – Connoisseurs Choice (Gordon and MacPhail) for dessert, Paula however opted for the distillery own bottling (OB) from Longmorn, rapidly becoming her favourite distillery.Colour:Amber blush goldNose:Blossom, honeysuckle, cherry blossom, flower bouquets, fruity honey, oranges and tannic suede leatherTaste:Smooth with an initial cayenne pepper spice, thick and syrupy in the mouth this has fragrant jasmine tea, buttery cookie dough, sugary sweet with a likening to Haribo’s tangfastic or fizzy fishFinish:Long, oily with tropical fruits such as lychee and guavaWould we buy it again:I think this OB has firmly cemented Paula’s love of Longmorn, though this lacks a little of that rose and lemon / Turkish delight there is still a lot of floral fruitiness in this expression that she really enjoyed.

For me this character presents as  slightly woody (almost new wood) with a little sweetness and cereals though both very light and delicate. Personally I feel the best Tullibardine expressions I have had have been cask-finished (Sauternes, Sherry, etc.) in which that character is never lost but just adds to the overall experience. This is light and likely from a refill bourbon barrel possibly anywhere from 8-12 years old at a guess. Don’t let the very pale colouring put you off, this has plenty of character and flavour and makes a delicious dram for sitting and enjoying in your garden while the sun shines.

Bob Delgarno, The Macallan Whisky Master, has hand-picked individual 100% sherry oak casks to deliver the rich colour that distinguishes this expression – a Single Malt of exemplary flavour and character.The Macallan’s six pillars:The Spiritual Home – Easter Elchies House proudly watches over the distillery in Speyside, Scotland. Built in 1700, this Jacobean manor house is the Macallan’s spiritual home.Curiously Small Stills – The Macallan’s curiously small and uniquely shaped copper stills help concentrate the flavour of the ‘new make’ spiritThe Finest Cut – The Macallan takes one of the finest new make spirit ‘cuts’ of any distillery in Scotland – typically a mere 16%Exceptional Oak Casks – The Macallan 1824 Series is exclusively matured in sherry oak casks drom Jerez, Spain.

A quiet note of vanilla is followed by dark chocolate with lingering floral and light oak notes.Palate:Citrus and boiled sweets rule the palate, along with hints of ginger and cinnamon, while soft oak tones reveal toasted apples.Finish:Medium sweet, malty and slightly dry.",":Usually priced at around £35, this is the new entry level Macallan as it is the cheapest of their 1824 series of no-age statement (NAS) whiskies, replacing their older more standard named predecessors. The new series are named after their colours, namely Gold, Amber, Sienna and Ruby. This range is based on the premise that age doesn’t matter but the level of maturation achieved within the cask is better represented by the final colour of the whisky. All these whiskies are matured in sherry oak casks.

The finish adds further soft fruit notes before the final surprise warm fresh apple pie. Wow can we have some more?!",":Speyside (or ‘The Speyside’) distillery is a relatively unheard of distillery, not least due to the confusion its name must produce. Whilst most supermarkets stock a ‘Speyside’ whisky, the whisky in the bottle will have been distilled at an unknown/un-named distillery within the Speyside region (most likely one of the big hulking distilleries that produces several millions of litres of spirit each year for blending – see Diageo’s new Roseisle for example). The Speyside distillery in comparison produces a rather modest 1/2 a million litres per year; again mostly blended, however a small amount escapes to remain as single malt. The Speyside distillery have a had a limited range of official bottlings (OB) in recent history including a 10, 12 and 15 year old on various occasions. I had been investigating independent bottlings of The Speyside whisky for a little while when I cam across this particular one. The main reason I purchased this one was because it was also one of the Whisky Shop’s Glenkeir Treasures Selection. This is a set of whiskies; presumably small batch or even single cask (?) that the Whisky Shop purchase and then sell from there shops in giant tapped casks, allowing you not only to choose your exact bottle size but also potentially bottle your own. I was curious about the quality of the Glenkeir Treasures range (and so I purchased a 2nd one that would allow me to compare it to other whiskies and a particular distillery I was well acquainted with).Colour:Cloudy golden apple juice (the entire stock seemed cloudy)Nose:Lemon juice (jif), cereal oats and pineapple creamTaste:Malty cereal and oats , slightly fizzy citrus, buttery and oily, sweet vanilla icing sugar, bitter oaky wood, pineapple tarts, shortcrust pastry, cream and sweet pineapple flavouringFinish:The finish was a little watery but also quite oily and long with more of that cereal malt and creamy fruitsWould I buy it again:I was actually quite taken with this whisky, however I felt its one flaw was that it had been over-watered down to achieve the Whisky Shops target 40% ABV. The whisky itself was thick with oily tears, resulting in the clouding but also the phenomenal amount of flavours going on despite the dilution. This cloudiness also indicates that the whisky has not been chill-filtered. This is a boon as chill-filtering removes some of the flavour and character from the whisky; basically the flavourful oils in the whisky are usually solubilised within the alcohol content. Cooling or reducing the alcohol content (by dilution with water) leads to the fats becoming insoluble and so they form small droplets (or micelles) within the water. This mix of water and oil is known as an emulsion (like paint, mayonnaise, vinaigrettes and milk), however emulsified whisky seems to be quite off-putting to the casual drinker and so often the oils are removed/reduced by chill-filtering. Chill-filtration is a process whereby the whisky is cooled and passed through a series of filters (previously asbestos, but now quoted as cardboard – as asbestos is a bad word?) which remove the droplets of oil and most importantly the flavours they contain.During a whisky tasting masterclass I attended, one of the attendees asked what the difference was between ‘non chill-filtered’ and ‘un chill-filtered’. The host replied (correctly) “None, why?”. “Ah” said the bemused attendee “I though un chill-filtered whisky was produced by chill-filtering out all the impurities and then mixing them all back in again…”. Every day is a school day.Anyway – this is one of the tastiest (and definitely the cloudiest) 40% ABV whiskies I have tried; I think next time I will look out for something with a little higher ABV from The Speyside, especially if this oiliness is a character of their spirit; though I can’t rule out the possibility of some of it deriving from the cask it was matured in.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Speyside Tagged as: 13 Years Old, 82 points, Chill filtering, Glenkeir Treasures Selection, Single malt Scotch, Speyside, Speyside single malt scotch whisky, The Speyside 13 year old - Glenkeir Treasure Selection, The Speyside Distillery, The Whisky Shop, Uncategorized, Whisky ",£21

After closing in the 1950s the site was bought by Joseph Hobbs, who also ran the Ben Nevis Distillery and converted it into Lochside Distillery. The new distillery contained 4 pot stills and a 21 metre high Coffey Still. Lochside Distillery was one of a few distilleries which produced both malt and grain whisky. Following the death of Joseph Hobbs, his son, also Joe, ran the distillery until it was acquired by Destilerias y Crianza, of Madrid, in 1973. The main purpose for the distillery was to produce Scotch Malt to blend with their own Spanish spirit. After years of industrious production Lochside Distillery fell victim to the drinks industry over-production problems of the early 1990s.Colour : Light gold.Body: Medium.Finish: Drying.Cask Type: Refill Bourbon barrels.Style: Subtle Highland malt balanced with the sweetness from the bourbon casks.AROMA without  water: Sweet, scented, hint of camphor and a toasted maltiness.TASTE without water: Sweet and spicy, malty notes again present.AROMA with water: Perfumed with nutty aromas, the sweetness is now in the background.TASTE with water: Smoky initially with earthy/herbal notes.",":During a recent shopping trip in Edinburgh, Paula and I decided to finally sample the Whiski Rooms in Edinburgh for a spot of lunch. I had been wanting to try it for ages but unfortunately the last opportunity had been Burn’s weekend (a night is no longer enough for the famous bard!). As such everywhere in Edinburgh was serving set Burn’s meals with Haggis (which I love) but we felt wouldn’t give a true representation of the place’s cuisine. Anyhow, after a fantastic lunch we perused their lengthy whisky menu and picked out a couple of choice drams for dessert. I opted for this Lochside simply because I had never sampled this closed distillery and stocks of Lochside whisky must be getting reasonably low enough to mean that I may never have tried it if I didn’t hurry up about it!Colour:Pale gold (indicative of its refill bourbon barrel maturation)Nose:Biscuits and cereals, freshly baked plain scones; fruity peaches and apricots and a little earthen peat with hints of nuttinessTaste:An initially spicy cinnamon gives way to fruity and peaty bodied flavours that felt a little thin, the cereal and biscuit flavours from the nose returned on the palate but I was left with a sense of abrasiveness, perhaps 13 years is still a little young on this spirit?Finish:Sharp and prickly then distinctly heart-warming; settles down to a long fruity jammy finish with hints of strawberriesWould I buy it again:While it was definitely a pleasurable experience to sit and sip whisky from a lost distillery, whilst watching the world go by to the backdrop of the heart of Edinburgh, I am unsure if I would purchase a full 70cl bottle of this even if one were available. At auction, Lochside whiskies – including this 13 year old from Gordon & MacPhail – must be fetching a pretty penny these days. This seems to be one for the collectors as it tasted a little young and brash but with a lot of potential in it. Lets hope there is still some Lochside stock sitting maturing away somewhere in Scotland and maybe again one day our paths will cross.

My favourite on sampling them in the store was the latest ‘Bass’ bottling 24 year old Bunnahabhain. I couldn’t resist a cheeky wee bottle of this Tomatin at 19 Years Old though. I have pretty much sampled the complete range of original bottlings from Tomatin having visited the distillery and also been treated to a tasting event (read all about it here: Tomatin whisky tasting masterclass at Wood Winters). I had not as yet come across an independent bottling of Tomatin and was intrigued at sampling this, especially at cask strength,  and comparing it to their 15 and 18 Year old OB’s.Colour:Full goldNose:New paint and nail polish at first revealing its cask strength nature, sweet and gentle aromas of honeysuckle and jasmine flowers  become increasingly woodyTaste:Warming, malted cereal barley, honey and golden syrup sweetness and sugary wood a little fruity grapefruit pith and zest give way to more oak wood, pineapple, vanilla and coconutFinish:Fruity and mouth-watering with hints of tropical fruitsWould I buy it again:Absolutely, this is a very fine Tomatin expression revealing some of the tropical fruit character that is a signature of their distillate, combined with a little more oaked ageing to develop slightly thicker and creamier vanilla and coconut flavours from the bourbon cask. Very drinkable at cask strength, this one was so smooth it did not need water. The Tomatin 18 year old is a sherried bottling and so has little to draw comparison. This 19 Year Old Fidra bottling by Lockett Bros is similar to the Tomatin 15 Year Old OB that has been extra-matured for a further 4 years.

Loki is Thor’s adoptive brother, a mischievous soul, possibly even a shape-shifter and certainly an enigmatic character. Highland Park have sought to create a whisky that matches Loki’s unique personality with this 15 year old single malt. Unusually, some heavily peated casks were used for part of the maturation.Nose: Salty sea spray jumps out the glass at first before revealing candied orange peel and a more refined version of the balsamic note present in other Highland Parks. Buttery toffee, raisins and oatiness. Or is it actually waxy with hints of ginger? What was that about shape-shifting again? Stewed apples and lemon zest now… and lime… and a little honey…Palate: A hit of sweet smoke from the peated cask maturation gives way to cinnamon, ginger and increasingly nutmeg with marmalade. Slippery. (No really!)Finish: Milk chocolate, ginger, a little marzipan before the toasted cloves that Highland Park promise make a late appearance.Overall: This is a great dram. For the full ‘Loki’ effect I would actually advise not adding water even at 47.8% abv but doing so will reveal yet more notes (aniseed, marzipan, more ginger).

None of the vessels however are completely emptied and so the average age of maturation within each vessel slowly accumulates. At Glenfiddich the use of a vatting vessel (or Solera tun) was pioneered by their past Malt-Master David Stewart. The Solera Tun is never truly emptied and so some of the flavours of the final product have been maturing in the vat since its inception. David Stewart is emulating this process today by using the Tun 1401 marrying vat at The Balvenie and producing batches of whisky from mixes of individual casks of various ages (as opposed to the continuous process he started at Glenfiddich). The results are not too dissimilar, however the scale of Glenfiddich’s output means that their “15” year old is a hell of a lot cheaper and more available than The Balvenie Tun 1401 batches.Colour:Orange goldNose:Sweet pears, mandarin oranges, cake or cookie dough, slightly herbal (rosemary?) and flowery (rose petal/rose water) aromas and hints of acetone (nail polish) indicative of ‘very’ aged whiskyTaste:Smooth and mellow on the palate this is lighter and more vaporous than the Glenfiddich 12 Year Old, redolent with mandarins and clementines, creamy and with hints of spicy ginger and cinnamon until turning eventually a little waxyFinish:The finish is quite long and very sweet with a honey flavour that almost becomes like icing sugarWould I buy it again:Absolutely, I didn’t want to pre-empt our review of the 18 Year Old next but I suspect the 15 Year Old Solera will take some beating. I expect this will turn out to be the best (and our favourite) of the bunch. I already have a hearty love for the Glenfiddich 14 Year Old Rich Oak expression and this one ticks all the boxes and then more. I would repeat my comments above about this being almost as good as the Tun1401 expressions but a lot less expensive. This definitely goes onto my whisky shelf as another of those standard/stable distillery expressions, available in most supermarkets, that is really really fantastic whisky. I feel a little spoilt drinking it.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Glenfiddich Tagged as: 15 Years Old, 86 points, David Stewart, Glenfiddich, Glenfiddich Distillery, Malt Master, OB, Solera, Speyside single malt scotch whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky ",£30-35

The neat cluster of buildings, virtually unchanged in the last 150 years, houses equipment only just capable of producing commercial quantities. Indeed, only 12 casks a week are produced, making Edradour Single Malt Whisky a rare pleasure for a fortunate few.Using skills handed down over the generations, the men of Edradour Distillery follow the standards of those who have gone before. Only three in number , as there always have been, they continue to produce the finest single malt whisky available. A truly hand-crafted malt, Edradour is golden in the glass (natural colour), with a delicious aroma of sugared almonds and a hint of Oloroso. The smooth, creamy, light malty taste is followed by a mellow warming finish.",":Not to be confused with Erebor, a dragon doesn’t live here and dwarves are not trying to claim back their home. Apart from those two simple facts, Edradour could be straight out of fantasy fiction (Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit) with its beautiful little collection of buildings nestled out of sight of the excise men, Orcs and Sauron in the glen above Pitlochry. I would recommend anyone wishing to visit a Scotch Whisky Distillery visit Edradour and you will see and learn how Scotch was traditionally hand-crafted before the Victorian Era, the age of industrialisation and the modern-day mass corporations and their space-age whisky factories.

I don’t usually recommend (or resort) to rocks to calm my whisky but this one needs it IMHO. If you like your whisky to go down like a handful of gravel then this one is for you!

Billy’s father went to work there before him, in 1950. As did his father before him, in 1949. Billy’s other grandfather had done so rather earlier, in 1914. As had his father before him in 1888. And his father-in-law before him, earlier in the 1880s. Which makes five generations; keeping up with the Stitchells is no easy task.",":After reading the Handbook of Whisky – Dave Broom I was keen to try an un-peated expression of Caol Ila’s single malt whisky.

It is very reminiscent of the Ardbeg Corryvreckan but without any (or with very little) peat influence. It really feels like something is missing from this dram and I can only assume it is a little something from the peaty influence. Normally I am not a huge fan of Caol Ila as I associate the smoky peat flavour with cigarette smoke/ash, (possibly one for the smokers or ex-smokers?) I just find this a little off-putting in my drink. The Stitchell Reserve is an interesting a well-constructed whisky but sadly not to my taste. I guess my biggest disappointment was in searching for the ‘Highland-Style’ superb blending whisky I kinda missed the boat here and bought something unpeated but very ‘finished’ from Caol Ila. Fortunately it was on the sensible side of Diageo’s special release pricing schedule so I and others won’t be too upset if they have bought a bottle plus it has a great heritage and history behind it.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Caol Ila Tagged as: 82 points, Alcohol by volume, Billy Stitchell, Caol Ila, Caol Ila distillery, Cask strength, Diageo, Diageo Special Release, Distillation, European Oak, Islay single malt scotch whisky, NAS, OB, Peat, Unpeated single malt, Whisky ",null

Littlemill sat on the cusp of the lowland/highland scotch whisky regions but its whisky was classed as lowland style. Possibly one of the oldest working distilleries in Scotland from ~1772 to 1930 triple-distillation was practised at Littlemill (as still is at Auchentoshan today). The distillery produced three different kinds of whisky: a heavily peated variety “Dumbuck”, a full bodied whisky “Dunglas” and a light traditional lowland whisky under its own name “Littlemill”. Dumbuck and Dunglas were discontinued in 1972. What stocks are left of Littlemill is unknown, although independent bottlings are still being released such as the recent expression from That Boutique-Y Whisky Company (released ~end 2013).Colour:Light goldNose:Flowery daffodil, estery, icing sugar sweetness, grassy, new paint, perfumed hints of maraschino cherryTaste:Tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, sour grapefruit, coconut, pina colada, cinnamon fireball gobstoppers, extremely hot cinnamon burn, very sweet and sugary  though with a thin and slightly oily mouthfeelFinish:Shortish finish, more icing sugar sweetness that develops a little sourness and becomes woody, reminiscent of guavaWould I buy it again:Unsure if I would purchase this expression again as it is not the easiest drinker. For the opportunity to sample what can only be limited and dwindling stocks of Littlemill’s output though I would jump at the chance of trying any further expressions that may get released (and hopefully not have astronomical price tags). This is certainly interesting and perhaps has some familiarity with Auchentoshan though I have never felt either befitted the ‘Lowland-Style’ classification due to their own uniqueness.

There is nothing in excess in this expression, perhaps proving its quality as a blending dram. This is also a good example of when not to judge a dram by its colour as there is plenty of aged flavours in here and only a slight indication of the ABV strength (50%) at which it is eminently drinkable without the need for watering down.

I found this example to be full of character and a pretty cracking dram. Sure I wouldn’t choose it everyday as there is a lot of powerful fruitiness in here and not of the palate-cleansing variety, this is the sugary sticky lingering type that leaves the roof of your mouth a little fizzy afterwards, but definitely a pleasurable experience to drink.

Akin to many Malt Whiskies, there is very little bottled as Single Malt, especially older examples such as this rare 30 year-old.The nose is engaging with some classy fruity depth and ancient polished oak.

Even in its last few decades, official bottlings have been hard to find to outright rare, including the flora and fauna bottling produced during its ownership by United Distillers, though it has occasionally appeared as a ‘Deerstalker’ bottling on occasion during its ownership by Inver House.

This is an outstanding bottling from Berry Bros & Rudd. Incredibly drinkable even at cask strength and a snip at the cost considering its lengthy maturation time.

Two Elgin whisky merchants took up the tenancy for a few years before the Munro family transferred ownership into a business called Munro and Cameron. Robert Cameron becomes sole owner a few years later adding to his portfolio which included Tamdhu, Linkwood and Benrinnes. However like many whisky distilleries the next part of the ownership story may sound familiar. Teaninich was sold to Scottish Malt Distillers in 1933 and fell silent during World War 2 and was taken over by Diageo some time later.Investment started to flow into the whisky distillery over the 1970’s and 1980’s with the still house being refitted, steam replacing the coal furnaces and an additional 3 pairs of stills added. Much the distillery was rebuilt and would be largely unrecognisable to the founders today. This split the distillery in 2 parts and the older of the parts was mothballed in 1985, both sides were mothballed at this time but the newer distillery was re-opened in 1991.  A year later the first official bottlings of single malt scotch whisky was released by Teaninich.Taste: Most describe Teaninich as Malty & Fruity both on the nose and palate with a gentle smoke in the finish.”",":Received as a Christmas present this 5cl Drinks by the Dram sample I expect would be around the £4-£5 mark. I have a sneaky suspicion I have tried this before whilst visiting one of Diageo’s distilleries (perhaps Cardhu or Glenkinchie?).

I am not sure if I would want a full 70cl bottle but I was beginning to think by the end of this dram that it would likely disappear rapidly if I did. Paula suggested this is a great starter whisky [i.e. for whisky novices] as it is drinkable and not too complex though there is a little sour note within it that may not be to everyone’s liking. My overall opinion was that this is smooth, mellow, buttery and rounded – very pleasant but not dripping with character or depth.

This 10 years of age gives it great power and intensity with integrated flavours from the sherry oak. Gentle and mouth filling with toffee apple, light chocolate notes and a long finish.",":I had been looking out for this particular expression after a heads-up on Twitter that Glenfarclas were launching a 2003 10 years old via Marks and Spencers. This hit the shelves at £35 but was instantly discounted to £30 so it was really a no-brainer to purchase this bottle.Colour:Deep russet amber goldNose:Oloroso sherry pours out, sweet red fruits, dry leather and nutty aromasTaste:Warming chocolate covered raisins, smooth malted barley, a strong toffee and honey sweetness pervades with hints of hazelnutsFinish:Medium-length finish like dark chocolate slowly melting in the mouth, the age starts to show through with a little coffee-like bitterness, slightly rough and may benefit from a drop of waterWould I buy it again:Absolutely, here is a perfect example of what Supermarket Malt Whisky should be all about, despite being seasonal and a relatively limited bottling release, this was purchased expressly for the festive period and performed admirably, in fact outstanding, when compared to much more expensive and exclusive bottles of whisky. This is a little sherry-monster but completely accessible and drinkable. The similarity to M&S Oloroso sherry [reviewed here] was also uncanny, making me wonder about the provenance of the Glenfarclas casks used to produce this whisky…Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Glenfarclas Tagged as: 10 Years Old, 2003 vintage, 84 points, Alcohol by volume, Glenfarclas, Marks & Spencer, Oloroso, Scotch, Scotch whisky, Sherry, Single malt, Single malt whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky ",null

This now seems unnecessary as Aberlour is a phenomenal whisky in its own right as can be seen in this first batch, bottled by ‘That Boutique-y Whisky Company’.‘That Boutique-y Whisky Company’ bottles single malts, blended malts and blends from a variety of renowned distilleries. These whiskies are adorned with cultish comic book-style labels.The label features the world-famous ‘Mash Tun’ whisky bar in Aberlour. In the top window cowers a man looking terrified for his life, who andfor what reason we may never know…175 bottles of this batch were produced.Tasting Note by The Chaps at Master of MaltNose: Raisins and dried apple lead to cox apples, cloudy apple juice, ground ginger and roast cocoa beans with maybe the slightest hint of smoke.Palate: Rich, fruity and mouth-filling, with additional notes of ginger, barley and bitter dark chocolate.Finish: The finish is substantial and well-rounded with burnt dry fruits, autumnal berries, Pink Lady apples and brandy cream flavours.Overall: Classic Aberlour apple gives way to a deeper chocolate ginger character on the palate and finish. Full-flavoured and more-ish.",":Received this as a Christmas present [in 2012] from my nearest and dearest as she knows how much I rave about Aberlour’s whisky and I had already acquired a generous amount of their expressions. I think she was most attracted to this particular bottle as it was relatively inexpensive [though the fact it was only a 50cl bottle perhaps wasn’t noticed until it arrived] and it was a limited bottling cask strength Aberlour. This particular bottle sold out within days of being released on Master of Malt, so perhaps her deductive reasonings were well-informed. Plus you really can’t go wrong with offering me bottles of Aberlour whisky as  present!Colour:Dark russet/amber goldNose:Crisp and fresh Bramley or Granny Smith green apples, sweet peach and orange/esters, nail polish/acetone, sherry leather fizz, walnut, cereal barley malt and a little yeast.Taste:Warm toffee apple sweetness, fudge and brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg spices, raisins and brandy [or calvados] butterFinish:Very sweet fresh green apple, a little spearmint, prickly sugar and spiceWould I buy it again:This is very gentle for its strength with lots of sweet fruits and fresh green apple flavours with gently zingy spiciness. The distinctive apple-y Aberlour spirit really shines out of this cask strength bottling, this is a lot smoother and more refined then the A’Bunadh leading me to suspect that it is somewhat older though the age statements are not declared on TBWC bottlings. Based on this expression I suspect they are perhaps bottling very good quality single casks that display the particular Distilleries character in a slightly different setting perhaps to the usual distillery bottlings. In this example for instance the Sherry influence is not as full on as it can be in the stable Aberlour expressions. Regardless this was a very well received present and a damn fine dram.

I love the chocolatey-ness of Tobermory 10YO, but the Ledaig seems a little mixed up to me. A distinct mix of fruit and bitter which works really well but is a bit of a mouthful to drink. I think given the choice I would go for the Tobermory 9 times out of 10. Paula on the other hand really didn’t agree with this malt, its’ not got the depth of peat that Islay malts give, nor the out and out fruitiness of some of the highlanders or sherried Highland/Islay whiskies.

My first encounter with Tobermory whisky was as part of a dish at a restaurant in which they had used this whisky in the sauce! [Specifically this was a Work’s ‘Do’, Christmas Lunch at Elliots restaurant – part of the Apex Hotel on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh; the dish was Highland Venison in a chocolate and whisky sauce]. I remember thinking afterwards I didn’t really get the taste of single malt whisky, but then I hadn’t tried Tobermory. A year or so later I purchased a bottle for around £20 and discovered inside two of my most favourite things; a whisky that tasted of chocolate! In the end I drank this far too quickly to take notes so I recently purchased a £5 50ml miniature from the Deanston distillery [sister distillery in the same group]. Sadly I learned that in times of duress [circa. 1990’s] the Tobermory distillery sold their warehouse for development into housing, and so all their spirit is now matured next to the River Teith near Doune [in the Deanston]. So any sea salt picked out in the tasting must come directly from the distillate…Colour:GoldNose:Bitter dark chocolate and sweet fruity honey a little like peaches or strawberries dipped in chocolateTaste:A little earthy peat, chocolate and malt [bournvita] with dark bitter cocoa [like Cadbury’s Bournville instant chocolate drink] or coffee, musty/musky wood like the wooden smell from dunnage warehouses, a little fermented flavour and some spicy cinnamon.Finish:Shortish smooth and sweet milky chocolate, a little almond, mellow and warming for an overall medium-length finishWould I buy it again:Whisky and chocolate in the same glass, ’nuff said. Yes I would buy this again and again and again. Hats off to the Chef by the way – this is the perfect whisky for any rich chocolate sauce whether pairing with venison or dessert! If preparing for dessert I would also recommend adding a little wasabi, sounds crazy but it actually adds a minty flavour to the sauce.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Tobermory Tagged as: 10 Years Old, 82 points, Alcohol by volume, Bournville, Cadbury, Deanston, Deanstondistillery, Doune, Edinburgh, Malt, OB, Single Malt - Tobermory, Single malt whisky, Ten Years Old, Tobermory, Tobermory 10 Years Old, Tobermory distillery, Uncategorized, Whisky ",null

It has a very homely and familiar feeling to drinking it, much like the comfort of tucking into a piece of hot-buttered toast on a cold and frosty morning [especially if someone else made it – as other peoples toast always tastes better!]. With all the craze of finished whiskies and rare old whiskies etc. I had forgotten just how good simple whisky could be. Admittedly the history of distilling at the Deanston distillery is not as old as many of the other distilleries, and their whisky can be more difficult to find [unless you come across the 40%ABV expression specifically bottled for Marks and Spencers], but it is well worth seeking out and trying!Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Deanston Tagged as: 10 Years Old, 83 points, Alcohol by volume, Brown sugar, Deanston, Deanston 12 Year Old, Deanston 12 Years Old, Deanston 12 Years Old (Official Bottling), Deanston distillery, Demerara, Distillation, Food, Malt, OB, Scotch whisky, Scotland, Single malt whisky, Whisky ",null

Like the mountains themselves, little has changed over the centuries. We still use water., filtered through peat to the granite below before bubbling up as pure crystal spring water – soft, slightly acidic and perfect for whisky making. We then distill this single malt in time-honoured fashion before gently air drying with a hint of peat smoke to impart a light smoky flavour. Finally, this classic highland malt is matured in oak casks previously used for Bourbon or Sherry to impart a richly rewarding fruity complexity. The result? – A full-bodied whisky with subtle floral notes, hints of oak and a delectable spicy sweetness.Rich, full and bursting with sherried fruit, with creamy oak, a hint of peat and a delicious sweetness… the finish is long and flavoursome with a lingering spiciness. Expertly distilled with pure highland spring water and barley, then matured in American or Spanish oak casks originally used for Bourbon or Sherry to achieve its unique fruity flavour.",":I noticed this as soon as it hit the shelves at ASDA due to the new packaging in the Extra Special range, selected by J. Glass and Leiths school of food and wine. Part of the mystery of this peaty, partially sherried highlander was the colour itself. I took a punt on this £20 bottle as I figured the possibilities of buying a NAS sherried peaty highland whisky for this price must be quite slim, and I wanted to try and guess where it was from.Colour:Deep Caramel goldNose:Earthy toffee and caramel, estery floral honey and fudge, sweet caramelised brown sugar and herbal cardamomTaste:Chocolate, heather honey, earthy peat and delicate spiced nutmeg, hazelnut and giandujaFinish:Medium, sweet and mellow with more fudge, a little salt and lots of nutsWould I buy it again:Absolutely, this is actually rather fine whisky with plenty of character. It is full bodied and spicy and fruity and has quite a pronounced peaty tang both on the nose and the palate. My experience of Highland Distilleries is a little limited as I have my favourites from which I have tried a lot, I have tried some only once and there are others I have yet to even try. Something about this Highland Single Malt however is very reminiscent of a whisky I tried when visiting Blair Athol distillery, in particular the distinct nutty flavours at the end, although the salt threw in a little confusion [and I would suspect lead others to presume perhaps Clynelish].So what is ASDA extra special Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky? My guess would be Blair Athol, this Highland distillery produces around 2.5 million litres of spirit each year, they peat their barley, they mature in bourbon casks for blending into Bell’s and sherry casks for their own single malt expressions and I’m sure they would have a little spare for bottling for a major supermarket such as ASDA.Either way I guess we will never know, and that makes up part of the fun of drinking this. Others have already stated that due to the lack of distillery specification on these supermarket specials the whisky could in fact change from one batch to the next. I like the fact that it strips away the preconceptions and snobbishness attached to the knowledge it comes from one particular distillery or another, and in the end is evaluated pure and simply for what it brings to your glass.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Single malt, Undisclosed Tagged as: 78 points, Alcohol by volume, Aroma of wine, ASDA, ASDA Extra Special, ASDA HIghland Single Malt Whisky, Whisky ",£20.50

Sadly for us the spice didn’t seem to come through and I was left with a rich woody aftertaste like caramelised sugars. Considering I purchased this at almost 1/2 the standard retail price I still feel like it was a bit of a bargain.

Anthony Wills, Kilchoman Managing Director: “Sales of Machir Bay 2012 far exceeded our expectations so we hope people will be equally impressed with this year’s more mature offering”",":I have tried both the 2012 and 2013 Machir Bay on several occasions but never quite had the time or opportunity to make proper tasting notes. I was looking for an excuse to purchase even the 5cl miniature of this from Kilchoman when their latest club release gave me the perfect excuse to do so. For a young and short maturation whisky this is actually very very good! Very different from the expressions by other Islay distilleries, Kilchoman peat is very sweet and minimally smokey. I look forward to next years expression!Colour:Pale goldNose:Peat, woody smoke and sweet honey,  a little medicinal like germolene and sticking plastersTaste:Light and watery at first there is a delicate or subtle peaty flavour that is earthen and reminiscent of open wood fires or a beach barbecue, a little meaty with fragrant herbal and botanical elements such as aniseed and fennel coupled with a very sweet oil-seed rape honeyFinish:Medium length sweet, nutty and smooth with a lingering sweet peaty elementWould I buy it again:Absolutely, for all the peat that Kilchoman pack into the 2013 Machir Bay expression there is not the least element of harshness or roughness to this. While undoubtably the spirit is still young and feisty, it gives a zesty almost citrus-like nature to the final whisky. My only criticism of this whisky is that eventually I found it lacking depth and unable to fully support the hugely strong and punchy flavours it combines. I am completely confident that within the next few years a little more ageing will skyrocket this whisky up the ratings and further depth and complexity will bolster up these flavours with deeper honey flavours and syrupy textures. This young whisky is already punching way above it’s weight and is definitely one to watch out for future expressions, but equally one to buy, drink and enjoy now!Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Kilchoman Tagged as: 46% ABV, 79 points, Islay single malt scotch whisky, OB, Whisky review ",£39.60

I couldn’t resist the chance to try a Rosebank expression distilled on the banks of the Union canal in Falkirk, the distillery used to produce a Flora and Fauna bottling depicting the wild roses which grew so abundantly around the distillery site. This is a single cask expression distilled in 1991 and matured for 22 years before bottling at 55.2% cask strength as part of the Mackillop’s Choice range. A 3cl Drinks by the Dram sample set me back £13.55 for the latest release of whisky from this closed distillery. One of the saddest rumours I heard about the distillery was that there may have been some intention to re-open it until it was discovered that metal thieves had stolen the three stills for their copper value sometime around 2009.Colour:Caramel/Amber goldNose:Malted barley, new make spirit. cereals, sweet fruits, floral violets, golden syrup, toasted vanilla, apricots, a new green vegetal aroma and yeasty smells reminiscent of distillery washbacks in operation.Taste:Warm buttered toast, a little prickle of spice and sour pink grapefruit pith or zest, deep Demerara sugar, caramel, toffee and a light treacle flavour all intermingled in a syrupy mouthfeel.Finish:Long barley sugar and sweet caramel finish which is both cooling and refreshing, with time becomes a little drying then finishes with a slightly soapy mouth coating texture with slight lavender notesWould I buy it again:From this expression I fear the loss of Rosebank is a very sad one. Although Glenkinchie still operates as the closest functioning [also Diageo owned] distillery I hold no love [yet] for its expressions. This Rosebank expression has huge depth, character and complexity and was an immensely enjoyable dram. It is likely that if any more Rosebank expressions do come onto the market they are going to be prohibitively expensive [at least for more than 3cl!]. At least there is some good news and their will soon be a distillery in Falkirk once again [see: The Falkirk Distillery] and I look forward to sampling what they produce.

Royal Brackla is one of the few [3 to be precise] distilleries permitted to officially use ‘Royal’ in its name is one of the lesser heard of Highland distilleries. Not only was the distillery closed between 1985 to 1991, the previous owners [UDV] only official bottling was a 10 year old Flora and Fauna. The distillery was bought by Bacardi-Martini in 1998 via John Dewar & Sons Ltd to produce spirit for blending in Dewar’s whisky blends. Maturing stock was not part of the buy-out deal and the new owners took until 2004 to launch their own Royal Brackla 10 Year old [still hard to find and possibly sold only through the distillery]. This bottling from Mackillop’s Choice was distilled in the fabulous year of 1976! I picked up a 3cl from Drinks by the Dram for the princely sum of £7.55 [pardon the royal pun].Colour:Pale yellow goldNose:Lightly peated with a hint of smooth smoke, peanut, slight oaky wood, brown sugar, vanilla and flower pollenTaste:Smooth rich buttery caramel followed by a chlorine/swimming pool chemical flavour redolent of copper and fireworks, there are also hints of apples, and candy floss.Finish:The finish is long, salty and sulphuric which is strangely mellow and refreshing with hints of blackcurrantWould I buy it again:Both the colour and taste suggest refill bourbon barrel for this one, or minimal bourbon influence at least. Some of the chemical character of the distillate comes through in this but it is not unpleasant – perhaps just indicative of how single malts were being produced back in the 1970’s. I am now really keen to discover how the newer Royal Brackla expressions stand up to this aged beauty?

Imperial was built in 1897 by Thomas Mackenzie, who already owned the Dailuaine and Talisker distilleries. Like most Speyside distilleries this had a chequered history and spent long periods of closure. It was rebuilt in in the mid 1950’s but was already earmarked for demolition in 2005 during its last acquisition, but lingered on unused until 2013 before complete demolition. The owners already plan to build a new distillery on this site, which will likely assume the name Imperial. Few if any official bottlings ever came out of Imperial, and most of the spirit produced was likely destined for blending. This one was bottled by Signatory Vintage as part of their Un-chill filtered range from two [refill?] bourbon hogsheads.Colour:Pale GoldNose:Coloured pencil shavings, mashed banana or banana milkshake, sweet roses, pineapple and ‘Nice’ [coconut] biscuits.Taste:Green banana, pineapple chunks/cubes sweets, warming coconut white rum, green/virgin oak, tropical fruits, mild and smooth and cocktail-like [e.g. toasted pina colada] perfect for sipping on a beach in barbadosFinish:Drying and sharp/spicy, tannic and of medium lengthWould I buy it again:Sadly I suspect this is no longer available and neither is there likely to be much more of the ‘old’ Imperial whiskies commonly in circulation. This is a hugely fruity Speyside whisky and it still tasted fresh and young even at 17 Years Old. This makes an ideal summer night or bbq whisky and instantly lends itself to similarly themed food. I look forward to the possibility of a new Imperial distillery and hope they can capture some of the tropical fruit essence of the last one…Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Imperial Tagged as: 17 Years Old, 1995 vintage, 84 points, Closed distillery, Imperial, Signatory, Signatory UCF, Speyside single malt scotch whisky ",£38.36

Only 900 cases of this exceptional single malt will be rolled out globally from November 2013 with a retail price of £120 per bottle.Matured in American ex-bourbon and Spanish ex-sherry casks which previously held heavily peated whisky, each 700ml bottle is non-chill filtered at 46% ABV.  Amber in colour, on the palate this full bodied expression is sweet to start with a touch of spice and a long and intense smoky finish.To reflect the our rich maritime heritage, the 1990’s striking packaging features a ship decking effect on the outer tube, a porthole stamp and Old Pulteney’s classic herring drifter, which has become a symbol of the brand.Old Pulteney Senior Brand Manager, Margaret Mary Clarke commented:“After a very exciting year for the brand, which included a global partnership with Clipper Round the World Race, it’s great to finish off 2013 by adding a very special expression to our award-winning portfolio.

The 1990 Vintage expression has been constructed from 23 Years Old spirit matured in American ex-bourbon and Spanish ex-Sherry casks that once held heavily peated [Islay?] whisky. The result is astounding! I wondered about the provenance of the whisky casks and their previous inhabitants, perhaps it is just coincidence that OP’s parent company within the 12 months previous to this distillate leaving the stills had acquired a particular Islay distillery, fortuitously allowing them access to some pre-used casks…Colour:Gold, with an amber tingeNose:Orange, peach, toffee, salt, smoke, sourdough – like Herman cakeTaste:cherry, eucalyptus, slight raisin, little cocoa and malt (bournvita?), Black forest gateau. With a drop of water the smoke comes rolling out, very mellow and OP toffee, but loses the cherry and black fruits in the body.Finish:all the peat smoke is on the nose and just into the finish, long smoky salty caramelWould I buy it:Sadly way, way out of my budget, but a fantastic experience to taste and review it all the same. This is clearly aimed at the luxury market and it would be interesting to see if this is a one-off or the start of a stable of expressions aimed at the upper end of the price range?

Both on a good day can be had for around £20 from most supermarkets under offer [usually around about this festive time of year]. Both also represent some of the best whisky money can buy in this price range in my honest opinion! Whereas the Aberlour is sherried, this Old Pulteney expression is the perfect example of a slightly peated, slightly salty Highland malt that really sets the standard for its region. Tasted as part of the #PulteneyTT online twitter tasting, I have previously had 2 or 3 bottles of Old Pulteney 12 Years Old. They do not last long even within a reasonably sized collection such as we have, and certainly never long enough for me to make tasting notes on before!The Old Pulteney still famously has its top chopped off and the lyne arm sprouts from the side, presumably to fit under the roof, also a large boiling ball shape to aid reflux is apparent! During the tasting I quizzed @OldPulteneyMalt about this unusual setup who stated “nobody really remembers what it was like before. We don’t even know when it happened exactly. But the unusual shape of the stills has a tremendous impact on OP’s style. The shape and size affects reflux and copper surface contact. Very important. Our Master Blender – Stuart Harvey – says that the wash still with its huge boil ball is at the heart of the #PulteneyTT NMS style… Part of Pulteney’s complexity comes from traditional worm tub condensation which leaves the spirit heavy and flavoursome.” – I suggested they change nothing as the end product is fantastic!Colour:GoldNose:Toffee, salted caramel, honey, faint apples and fresh oranges and a little yeasty doughTaste:Honey, caramel, golden syrup, stewed apple and demerara sugarFinish:Finished with salty smokeWould I buy it again:Absolutely.

The more you drink this the more it reveals subtle flavours and elements which all swirl over the tongue effortlessly. I have to admit this is not knock-your-socks-off the best whisky I have ever tasted, but it is hugely drinkable and combines that coastal, slightly smoky toffee apple style that Old Pulteney produce and presents it perfectly. I would challenge most drinkers to find any fault or flaw in this expression, this is a step up from the 12 Years Old which to me is the ideal introductory whisky for new drinkers and I rate it very highly.

My overall feel for this one was that it is an exceptional dram and I would never have guessed that it was 21 Years Old. Therein lies the problem however, I would have expected perhaps a little more deep sherry wood influence and love the whole chocolate or Christmas spice elements that sherry finishing bring to whisky. Perhaps the Glen Grant spirit behind this is just a little too light and fruity still, even after all that maturation time and I felt it didn’t really bring much to the party. The result is more ginger nuts with Cointreau than the full on Christmas spice extravaganza I would have liked. That said if you want something apres-dining at Christmas time that is not too heavily spiced, or if you’re looking for an autumnal dram to warm you up after a walk in the woods admiring the colours of the season – then this is definitely for you.Thanks to Douglas Laing & Co Ltd. & The Whisky Wire for sampleRate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Glen Grant Tagged as: 1992 vintage, 21 Years Old, 88 points, Alcohol by volume, Campari, Christmas, Cointreau, Douglas Laing, Glen Grant, Glen Grant distillery, Malt Master, Scotch, Scotland, Sherry, Single malt Scotch, Twenty One Years, Uncategorized, Whisky ",null

The result is a truly charming Malt with a richly spiced character fused with vanilla (from the bourbon casks used), sweet stewed fruit, Christmas pudding, dark chocolate, zesty orange and sweet tobacco.No attention to detail has been missed in creating the Scallywag packaging. Inspired by the long line of Douglas Laing family Fox Terriers, which are renowned for being sweet yet rather mischievous dogs, it was therefore felt the Scallywag name and Fox Terrier design was most fitting for this richly spiced and deliciously sweet Speyside Vatted Malt.Says Douglas Laing’s Managing Director (and proud Fox Terrier owner) Fred Laing: “From a chance sketch by a designer of our sweet, wee, rascal of a Fox Terrier, our Scallywag Malt Whisky was born! “Sweet” was the key which focused us on Speyside. Its cask selection is self-evidently heavy on the sherry background, balanced by first-fill bourbon casks – so the resulting ‘Vatted’ Malt comes with an excellent pedigree”.Douglas Laing’s Scallywag will be available from specialist Whisky retailers from November 2013.Tasting Notes:Scallywag has a rich, dark colour – extracted from the many fine Spanish Sherry Butts selected.  It carries a richly spiced character on the nose woven into delicious vanilla from the Bourbon Hogsheads selected. On the palate detect layer on layer of sweet stewed fruit, Christmas pudding & dark chocolate fused with spice (nutmeg and cinnamon) much of which can be attributed to years slumbering in those Sherry Butts. The finish displays a burst of zesty orange with sweet tobacco, cocoa & rich fruit cake.",":Blind dram #1 at the #scallywag twitter tasting event.Colour:Yellow goldNose:sweet honey, vanilla, blossom, little acetone pear drops, slightly earthy and fruityTaste:thick and oily butter, vanilla, spicy drying oak, sweet stone fruits but with sour grapefruit finishFinish:Shortish and sour fruitsWould I buy it:",£36.49

The name – pronounced ‘culleela’, is gaelic for ‘Sound of Islay’. The distillery is appropriately hidden in a cove near Port Askaig, across which the ferry chugs to the nearby island of Jura.Gordon & MacPhail was established in 1895. Within a year, the founders were joined by John Urquhart, who took responsibility for the selection and bottling of fine and rare malt Whiskies. He later took over the business. In 1933 he was joined by his son, George, and during the 1960’s and ’70’s, George brought his own children into the family firm, passing on the skills he had inherited from his father. Today it is members of the 3rd and 4th generation of the Urquhart family that own and direct the business.The single malt whiskies in our private collection wood finish range have been personally selected by members of the Urquhart family.After an initial period of maturation, whiskies are transferred into wine casks sourced directly from some of the world’s most famous wine producing regions. After a further ‘finishing’ period the Single Malts are only bottled when the Directors consider them to be at their best.Sassicaia Wood Finish – Sassicaia is regarded as one of the most prestigious wines in the world. It is created in the exciting and fashionable Tuscan wine producing region of Bolgheri. After maturing in traditional casks for ten years, the whisky was transferred to Sassicaia casks for a further eight years maturation. The result is remarkably smooth – baked fruit aromas with hints of toffee apples, plain chocolate and an underlying peat smoke. The palate delivers toasted malt flavours enveloped by rich, mulled fruit notes. The distillery character emerges with peat smoke, birch wood and aniseed notes all present.","Bought this immediately after trying a sample at Lockett Bros shop in North Berwick. I have long been a fan of good wine finished whiskies and have tried several Caol Ila’s in the past as a colleague of mine is a huge fan of the distillery flavour and style. We suspect this is because being an ex-smoker, this Islay malt often leaves an aftertaste of gentle cigarette smoke on the finish which he appreciates and enjoys. This is another fine example from Gordon&MacPhail of marrying together strong and subtle flavours to create a whole new taste sensation.My tasting notes:Colour: Rusty orange/rubyNose: Smoky peat, peanut, very sweet esters, violets and grapefruit citrus notesTaste: Sweet warming oranges and pink grapefruit flavours with a light prickly spice, develops into a cigarette ash/smokeFinish: Sudden burst of more fruits including strawberries and limes, chocolate lime sweets, nutmeg and a long and delicate smoky bacon smoke vapour", £70

Fresh with a peaty depth reminiscent of the sea air on Islay.Smooth peaty flavours coat your taste buds and the marzipan returns softer with hints of pepper, citrus, floral notes and a soft smokiness. There is a sweetness coming through as you draw air into your mouth, overly ripened apples, sweet scented smoke and salty sea air.A wonderful dram (if we do say so ourselves). The natural cask strength of 44% is surprising given its age but once explored it reveals a delicate but perfectly balanced depth of flavour. Warning!

They personally ensure that only the highest quality spirit is filled into sturdy oak casks before being left to mature at Benromach for many years.  Only when it has matured to our highest quality standards do we bottle it and proudly label it – Benromach Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky.Benromach Distillery is owned and managed by Gordon & MacPhail – a family business for over 100 years.Limited Edition of 1300 bottlesAfter an initial maturation period the whisky is transferred into oak casks that have been used to produce wine from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée, in the northern Rhône wine region of France (just south of Lyon) and ‘finished’ for a further 22 months.

Smooth and balanced.",":I first tried Benromach whisky at the Scottish Garden Show 2012 when I had a sample of several of their range including their Organic and Peated expressions, both of which I was very impressed with. A little while later I stumbled across the Benromach Origins (at 50% ABV) as the dram of the week at the Cask and Barrel Southside in Edinburgh. More than likely it was one of those increasingly frequent occasions when my beloved ‘Noisy Neighbour Blue Manchester Soccer Team’ were obliterating the somewhat geographically confused “Liverpool is our real derby game”- Red Manchester Soccer Team’. Anyway stupid is as stupid does, I enjoyed it that much I went back for a double only to be told that due to its strength they were legally restricted from selling me a double measure. Only when I sat down disappointed did it occur to me I could have ordered one for myself and one for my ‘friend’! I spotted some Benromach expressions with a thin layer of dust on them on one of the higher shelves of the Hopetoun Farm Shop and took my chances on the Hermitage wood finish.

It is regarded by experts as the ultimate Scotch deluxe whisky, the benchmark by which all others are measured.Each bottle of BLACK LABEL will have been two decades in the planning and draws whisky from the finest distilleries across Scotland aged in the finest whisky casks. Each whisky is matured in a slightly different way, due to the intricacies of wood, climate and location. The Master Blenders’ skill is in blending these whiskies together to create a whisky with an extraordinary range of flavour.A continued focus on quality and style has resulted in JOHNNIE WALKER BLACK LABEL earning numerous awards. Today the blend remains as rich and smooth as it was when John Walker’s son and grandson were Master Blenders. It has been called “a masterpiece, the Michelangelo’s David of the blender’s art, the very best in its category” – Charles Maclean, whisky writer, and “the Savoy, the Everest of deluxe whiskies” – Jim Murray, author of the ‘Whisky Bible’.BLACK LABEL retains the authenticity of its creator and currently outsells every other deluxe Blended Scotch Whisky around the globe. That it’s stood the test of time is testament to the pioneering spirit and the skills of the Walker family.JOHNNIE WALKER has the luxury of having exclusive access to Scotland’s very best whiskies, ranging from the powerful west coast malts all the way to the more subtle east coast flavours. BLACK LABEL draws upon all these aromas to create a unique blend with a smooth, deep and complex character.It can be enjoyed on its own, with a dash of still or sparkling water, or with soda or ginger ale as a long drink.The origins of JOHNNIE WALKER BLACK LABEL go back to when John Walker’s son Alexander took over in 1857. Realising the genius and untapped potential of his father’s blends, Alexander focused on expanding the whisky side of the business.He drew inspiration from his father’s signature smoky style. And in 1867 he copyrighted ‘Old Highland Whisky’, which was the precursor of today’s JOHNNIE WALKER BLACK LABEL. By 1889, John Walker & Sons had businesses established in London, Sydney and Paris, and distribution agents appointed as widely as South Africa, America and India. At that time, few brands had such breadth of distribution.By the 1890s Alexander II and George, the grandsons of John Walker, were running the business. Following the innovative spirit of their forebears and the principle of providing high quality whiskies, these men carved out a new vision, identifying ways to drive it to new levels of commercial success.With marketing insight ahead of their time – the brothers understood the importance of producing an easily recognisable brand. The distinctive slanted black label was the key, and three years later in 1909 the words ‘BLACK LABEL’ appeared on the bottle for the very first time.",":Wow THEY have a lot to say!

I guess the Naked Grouse does have some luxurious sherried malt qualities floating around in it. At the end of the day I would probably spend my money on a warts and all single malt just because I celebrate the character and individuality of them which is so often lost in blends, leading me to think of them quite often as bland scotch whisky.

Swirl the glass and dip your nose into the torrents of tarry ropes, creosote and linseed oil rising from deep within the vortex. As you succumb to its power, a collision of waxy dark chocolate, warm blackcurrants and muscovado sugar pulls you under its spell with a burst of plump cherries and earthy pine needles leaping from its depths.Swirl water into the glass, and observe the magical collision of whisky and water. As the liquid warms up, the seething cauldron bubbles and bursts, as you edge closer to sniff a pot full of gutsy cayenne-peppered steak and oysters smothered in hot pepper sauce.

As you descend deeper, encounter a mouthful of black tarry espresso coffee that coats the palate with rich melted dark fruits (blackcurrants, blueberries and cherries) and bitter almonds. As the taste soaks in deeper, star anise and hickory dry out the palate before a surprise of chalky effervescent violets fizz to the surface.FinishLong, deep and remaining powerful into the finish with black tarry coffee, chocolate coated cherries and hot pepper sauce, the lingering memories of your mysterious and daring journey into Corryvreckan.",":The Corryvreckan was the first bottle of Ardbeg expression I bought and the first Ardbeg I had tried.

We have managed to source barriques that were previously used for maturing this wonderful wine. By filling these barriques with Tullibardine Single Malt for nearly a year this has allowed our whisky to take on a lovely rich golden colour with hints of ginger cake, orange peel and faint barley married with spice, sweet citrus and a very long, elegant finish.*To read more about Sauternes see Hazelburn 8 year old Sauternes Wood Finish",":I purchased the Sauternes finish Tullibardine immediately after tasting this expression in the tasting room at the end of the Tullibardine Distillery Tour. I had already bought and tried the Sherry finish [being an afficonado of sherry-finished whisky this seemed at the time like the most logical expression to plump for], however trying the Sauternes I realised my mistake!

This warms in the mouth and becomes acidic and drying like a good dry white wine then the taste separates leaving a mildly spicy fizz on the tongue whilst coating the roof of the mouth with cereal. This reminds me of sucking on boiled sweets like lemon barley sugars with a rogue pineapple cube thrown in the mix.Finish:The finish is medium to long with mouth watering fresh lemon and lime citrus fruitsWould I buy it again:Yes. This is like the white wine whisky equivalent to the red wine finish of Bruichladdich Rocks; however this has a more subtle blend of whisky distillate and white wine flavours and the Sauternes sweetness is well restrained. The current equivalent from Tullibardine is the 225† [denoting the 225 litre finishing barrique] – again from the tasting notes there appears to be great continuity of the Tullibardine output, such that I am sure I will likely find the 225 just as delicious as the previous Tullibardine Sauternes finish expression.† see http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/tullibardine/tullibardine-225-sauternes-finish-whisky/Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Tullibardine Tagged as: 78 points, Alcohol by volume, Bordeaux, Bruichladdich Distillery, Château D'arche, Malt, NAS, Oak, Oak (wine), OB, Sauternes, Sherry, Single malt whisky, Tullibardine, Tullibardine Distillery, Tullibardine Sauternes, Tullibardine Sauternes Finish, Tullibardine Whisky, Whisky, Wine tasting ",£45

Finally bottled and non chill-filtered, the distillery manager’s selected batches are marked with his signature.

I will definitely keep my eyes open for Independent bottlings and cask strengths though, as I suspect these may deliver on the finish where this one just falls short for me.

Many of them, like Glen Elgin, were built in the boom years just before 1900. But even as the new chimney stacks rose, trouble was brewing in the whisky industry. Glen Elgin’s designer, the renowned Elgin architect Charles Doig, made the prediction, that this would be the last distillery built on Speyside for fifty years. Even this turned out to be conservative; it was actually 60 years before Tormore became the next.At least, in Glen Elgin, the best was saved for last. And, in fact, little has changed in a hundred years.In the 1930s, it became part of Scottish Malt Distillers, for whom it was an important component of the well-known White Horse blend. Innovations were rare during Glen Elgin’s first half century though one was crucial – the site had partly been chosen for its ability to make use of abundant water supplies from the Glen Burn to drive a turbine that provided most of the power needed to run the machinery. As a result, electricity from the national supply was not needed until 1950. The early 1960s brought much needed investment and four new stills were finally added to the original two. Glen Elgin became available as a single malt and exports of a 12 year old expression, predominantly to Italy and Japan, began in 1977.As a Speyside malt, its style, of course, is smooth, mellow and sweetly honeyed. Soft spring water comes from the area of Millbuies Loch to the south-east of the distillery. Close your eyes as you nose a glass and you can almost see bees pollinating flowers, then honey- sweet and malty flavours dominate the palate – even a dash of tangerine fruitiness can be found. Tangerine fruitiness is the hand-crafted Glen Elgin’s “signature”, born of long and precise fermentation. An easily accessible single malt with Speyside fruit and sweetness.APPEARANCEFull gold.NOSESweet. Almonds, or maybe marzipan? Some orange juice. Perhaps a trace of sawn wood. With water, Speyside esters, nut oil and buttery fat, prawn crackers, traces of fresh pears; a whiff of smoke or steam; dense.BODYSmooth, medium.PALATEPleasant mouthfeel; sweetish, then dryish, with some acidity between; all well balanced.FINISHDryish, balanced finish",":I purchased a 3cl sample of this Glen Elgin 12 Years Old from Master of Malt for £4 to try out one of the lesser known distilleries under Diageo’s umbrella and continue my tasting tour of Speyside malts.Colour:Autumnal goldNose:Fruity and floral, yeast and barley come through with a damp mustiness and a little earthen copper. There is a certain fustiness to the odour that smells like something old and damp. More like tangerine skin & zest.Taste:This has honey and butter to begin with but then matures into something rather bitter like dark chocolate. This tastes like eating a tangerine whole, skin and all. Reminds me of Bournvita or Milo [malt & chocolate drink]Finish:Initially hints at sweetness but leads into creamy mouth-coating bitterness, incredibly smooth throughoutWould I buy it again:Probably not, this isn’t really to my taste. This is a shame as I love tiramisu and the thought of a creamy cocoa and coffee bitterness seems appealing at first, but sadly didn’t translate for me due to the fruitiness going on. For about the same price or a little more there appears to be some independent bottlings e.g. Connoisseurs Choice (Gordon & MacPhail)  or Dimensions (Duncan Taylor) that may be worth trying. This appears to be one of those whiskies that becomes quite classy, complex and interesting with age, if any of the other tasting notes for older expressions are anything to go by. Perhaps next time I will splash out on a sample of an older expression, until then there are many many more Speyside distilleries to sample.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Glen Elgin Tagged as: 12 Years Old, 64 points, Glen Elgin, Glen Elgin 12 Year Old, OB, Speyside single malt scotch whisky, Whisky review ",£37

Of the four whiskies in the current Jura stable, each attempts to sit in opposition to the other three in their flavour map with differing elements of light/richness, peatiness and complexity. Of the four, Prophecy is the only Jura whisky I haven’t tried yet. Jura Origin attempts to be light, delicate and is unpeated, Origin achieves the delicacy with ease, but sadly not a whole lot more. In general most of the Jura whisky I have tried is on the sweet caramel side which is pleasant but perhaps almost a little sickly in the Origin without too many other flavours.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Jura Tagged as: 10 Years Old, 40% ABV, 65 points, £30, Emperador, Island single malt scotch whisky, Isle of Jura Distillery, OB, Review: Isle of Jura Origin 10 Year Old ",null

A bracing, light and floral dram that expresses both the marine top-notes of classic Bruichladdich spirit and master distiller Jim McEwan’s lifetime experience. Jim has selected individual casks from our warehouses from a variety of vintages and then created this vatting, with further maturation in French red wine casks, allowing all the distinct components to melt together into this delicious, rounded and fruity dram. The quality is a testament to Jim’s cooperage experience, his extraordinary palate, the quality of the American and French oak, and the quality of the Rhinns of Islay water we use that for millennia has filtered up through the 1.8 billion year-old gneiss rock – the oldest rocks in the whisky world!characterLight, bright and full of joy!

I first tried the Bruichladdich Rocks as a free taster alongside each of the other Islay distilleries and this one particularly stuck in my mind. Firstly as there is no peat in this, and secondly as after a few seconds a distinct wine flavour pours out of this dram all over your tastebuds. This is a hugely pleasing and enjoyable dram, maybe not quite what you’d expect from Islay, but is a wonderful example of a non-specific wine-finished whisky.Colour:Pale rose gold, definite pinky hues – this one also clouds easily with lower temperatures, a sure sign all the good stuff is still in there!Nose:The nose starts out fairly oaky, though fresher than the mustiness of sherry-cask, then there is a little cereal aroma before the strawberry and cherry fruits zing out.Taste:This is a sweet, wine flavoured dram revealing a subtle balance between the wine and whisky.

The maturation process and cask selection are the exclusive responsibilities of the renown Malt Master, David Stewart, and his assistant. Only they know the exact length of maturation required and only when they are completely happy do they select a batch of 27 casks for blending, having tasted each one individually for quality and consistency. After further cask ageing at and just the right moment, the Malt Master decides when the whisky is ready for bottling and worthy of the signature metal monkeys that declare it to be Monkey Shoulder Triple Malt Scotch Whisky.Cheers to the men of the maltings. At one time, Monkey Shoulder referred to a temporary injury suffered by the malt men when turning the barley by hand. Whilst our malt men are among the few who still turn the barley manually, working conditions are now such that fortunately the injury has been consigned to the past. Today the name Monkey Shoulder lives on as an affectionate tribute to the malt-men of yore in recognition of the times they suffered for their art.Nose: Delicate floral notes are intertwined with a zesty citrus orange and fresh soft fruits (peaches and apricots). Hints of honey and spicy oak enveloped with a rich vanilla sweetness.Taste: Beautifully sweet and a rich vanilla flavour. Brown sugar and creamy toffee balanced with oak notes and just a hint of spice (cinnamon and nutmeg).Finish: Exceptionally smooth with a lingering sweetness.On its own it’s smooth and rich. However, this is a whisky that loves company and shows its versatility in cocktails.",":I purchased a 5cl miniature of the infamous Monkey Shoulder ‘triple malt’ from ASDA for £3 to see what this thoroughly modern blend was all about. This is from the brains at William Grant & Sons and is marketed as a hip new whisky for cocktail making and occasionally drinking as it comes. The blend is made from [likely] young spirit matured in bourbon oak casks from their Speyside distilleries; Glenfiddich, The Balvenie and Kininvie. The single malts are blended by one of the most experienced Malt Masters in the industry, David Stewart, and are likely vatted together for final maturation before bottling. The result is a highly drinkable but young tasting mixture that is not un-similar to a single malt.Colour:Rich gold colour [which may be thanks more to added caramel than cask-derived]Nose:Initially new paint and nail polish remover [acetones] gives way to ripe bananas [esters] or banana fritters and golden syrupTaste:Again ripe bananas, brown sugar and vanilla custard with some cereal malt. This feels very light in the mouth, and is very smooth.Finish:The finish is surprisingly long with a barley sugar sweetness that just continues on and onWould I buy it again:Probably not, though I much prefer this to malt & grain mixed blended whisky. At this price, or cheaper, there are plenty of pure single malts that have much more character and complexity [e.g. Old Pulteney 12 Years Old, Aberlour 10 Years Old or even The Balvenie Doublewood if found on offer] that I would rather spend my money on. However, I could be very cruel and buy this just to fool my anti-blend whisky snobs/friends as I think they would be hard-pressed on blind tasting to recognise this as a blend. In the end I think this is an interesting experiment and well-marketed attempt to sell palatable young spirit and perhaps convert or introduce younger or new drinkers to malt whisky. If I bought a full bottle, I expect I would be rapidly mixologising this to empty the bottle asap.WebRepcurrentVotenoRatingnoWeightRate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Blends Tagged as: 62 points, Alcohol by volume, ASDA, Balvenie, David Stewart, Monkey Shoulder, Monkey Shoulder bLended Scotch Whisky, NAS, Scotch whisky, Single malt whisky, Uncategorized, Whisky, William Grant & Sons, Wine tasting ",£25

A water wheel positioned beneath the floor for optimum performance, kilns redesigned to reduce heat loss – and waste extracted by Archimedean Screw, direct to the distillery’s own railway station. Few names other than Tamdhu so embody the‘Can-Dhu-Spirit’ of our grand Industrial Age.However, fine whisky is not created by technical innovation alone. Carefully selected barley was expertly malted, then combined with cold, clear water direct from the Tamdhu spring. The final ‘ingredient’: fine oak casks from the most trusted sources. Together, these elements combined to ensure the unswerving magnificence of every drop.113 years later the distillery fell silent, but its soul lived on. Fuelled by the same ‘Can-Dhu-Spirit’ and passion for quality that inspired those daring merchants an age before, Ian Macleod Distillers took on the challenge. A family enterprise, independent in thought and ownership, they set out to return the eminent distillery to former glory.To honour their efforts, the sherry casks in use today are of the same quality insisted upon in 1897.

A fruity Lowland malt, produced in Scotland since 1823, under the watchful eye of the distillery manager. Product of Scotland – people here say ‘ock-un-tosh-un’, but what’s a little pronunciation between friends? No other Scottish distillery insists on triple distilling every single drop – this gives our Lowland Single Malt Whisky a complex, gentle flavour. We’ve crafted Auchentoshan on the banks of the River Clyde since 1823, in the shadow of the Old Kilpatrick hills between Glasgow and Loch Lomond.Distilled in 1999 Bordeaux Cask Matured, Ltd Edition 11 Years OldThe open grain of French oak helps develop a full oaky character in this cask strength, non chill filtered release – the result is pleasantly sharp, countering the sweet Auchentoshan style. Autumn sunset to the eye, the aroma is citric sharp balanced by lingering creamy sweetness. On the tongue there’s vanilla with layered fruit and wood spices – then a long lingering finish.",":This is simply a beautiful combination of whisky and red wine. The Bordeaux region of France is the largest wine making region in the country. Centered around the town of Bordeaux, the red Bordeaux wine [claret] is produced from a variety of grapes including Merlot (62% by area), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and a small amount of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carménère (1% in total) picked, crushed and fermented in temperature controlled stainless steel vats. The must is then re-pressed and interred into 225 litre oak barriques for ageing, typically for around 12 months. Although many of the finer producing vineyards and sub-regions dominate production with Merlot grapes, aged wine is often blended before bottling and further ageing. Bordeaux wines in general tend to be fruity with little oak character and are intended to be drunk when they are young, before tannins develop. Certain sub-regions such as Saint-Emilion or Pomerol are renowned for producing fruitier wines with softer tannins whereas Graves and Medoc regions produce concentrated fruit and tannic wines that are intended to be cellar-aged before drinking. One of the best examples of claret comes from the Château Mouton Rothschild in the Paulliac region. This Auchentoshan is aged for 11 years in St Julian wine casks from top claret producer Chateau Lagrange. The cask maturation of Auchentoshan in Bordeaux Barriques results in a simply stunning whisky packed with juicy, syrupy fruit flavours.Colour:Autumn red goldNose:Sweet, fruity and yeasty, hints of teabread and datesTaste:This has a syrupy fruit jam flavour encompassing apple, orange, peach and figs. There is a spicy cayenne pepper kick at the beginning which warms and mellows into a dry oaky element, this is thick and rich feeling in the mouth.Finish:Long, warming and mellow with sweet fruit flavours boiling all the way up from the fuzzy warmness it createsWould I but it again:As long as Auchentoshan keep producing this then I will keep buying it. This is a fantastic example of how wine-finishing of a whisky can raise it to a whole other level. This boils around the mouth imparting deep earthy tannic red wine flavours while subtly trailing sweet vanilla and grassy Lowland Malt remnants. This whisky is a perfect match for grilled red meats including steak or game such as venison. Robust enough to stand on its own against seriously strong flavours. In fact I would suggest this whisky could easily replace claret where claret would be used in food pairings.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Auchentoshan Tagged as: 11 years old, 1999 vintage, 86 points, Auchentoshan, Auchentoshan 11 Year Old Bordeaux, Auchentoshan Bordeaux Cask, Auchentoshan distillery, Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon, Château Mouton Rothschild, Oak, OB, Old Kilpatrick, Scotland, Single malt whisky ",£40

Perhaps gaining popularity from some of the more reserved whisky drinkers, this is a very delicate easy-drinking whisky with some very pleasing flavours and aromas in it. In particular whenever I drink Dalwhinnie I call to mind coconut, coconut and a dash more coconut. I quite like coconuts – so I enjoy drinking Dalwhinnie.The Dalwhinnie distillery is set in stunning countryside just off the A9 between Blair Atholl and Aviemore – you can’t miss it. The large picturesque white distillery building is just off the main highway and is practically the only thing in the whole glen and is well worth stopping off at for a visit.

This whisky is also hugely popular with many of my guests and “non” whisky drinkers. I have a 20cl on the go from one of the classic malt range gift sets received as a gift from a great friend of mine after visiting Glenkinchie distillery recently. I suspect If I see another bottle in the supermarket on offer I’ll buy it again no questions. This whisky does exactly what it says on the tin and provides my coconut fix whenever I need one.

I still have a little fondness for Bowmore as they were my entry distillers into whisky tasting. A sprinkle of this is also great for whisky-flavouring foodstuffs when cooking, not a sin so long as the food does the flavouring justice!

At the price of this I would expect to re-buy it again and again. I would also like to try much more from Bowmore, especially as many of my Islay whisky bottles recently have come from the south, where the peat influences are much stronger. Bowmore give you a peaty whisky that is very tempered and balanced and therefore ultimately pleasurable to drink.

This triple cask combination delivers an extraordinarily smooth, delicate yet complex single malt, matured at The Macallan Distillery. Respected and admired by the world’s most sophisticated and discerning whisky drinkers, The Macallan remains the single malt against which all others must be judged. This peerless reputation has been built by The Masters of Spirit and Wood, those craftsmen at the heart of The Macallan since it was legally licensed in 1824.Easter Elchies House proudly watches over The Macallan Distillery in Speyside, Scotland. Built in 1700, this Jacobean manor house is The Macallan’s spiritual home. The Macallan’s curiously small and uniquely shaped copper stills help to concentrate the flavour of the ‘new make’ spirit. The ‘cut’ is the amount of distilled spirit collected from the stills. The Macallan takes one of the finest ‘cuts’ of any distillery in Scotland; only the best of the best, typically just 16% is selected to fill our casks. This distinctly robust and characterful ‘new make’ spirit is the starting point for all Macallan.At The Macallan, natural colour is something we insist on. It is the interaction of spirit and wood alone which delivers the rich diversity of colour evident throughout The Macallan range. Our whisky maker keeps a watchful eye on the slumbering casks, selecting the moment when each cask is at the peak of maturity and perfect for bottling. It is this mastery of spirit and wood that creates The Macallan… The world’s most precious whisky.Colour:Pale strawNose:Light and fresh, with a hint of coconut and ice cream waferPalate:Soft and smooth, balanced with oak and fruitFinish:Lingering, with a hint of oak and fruit",":I’m a big fan of The Macallan and their ethos of perfectionism in their whisky making. I’m often finding myself ordering any Macallan whisky on the menu after a good meal out in a restaurant as I know I’ll get something to savour and it will be rewarding. Their is an almost opulent quality in the flavour and feel of their whisky that suggest they have only picked the best. This is one of their entry level expressions that I picked up on offer in the supermarket in France, pretty much because usually the price tag on Macallan whiskies are a little higher and out of my comfortable price range.Colour:Dark gold but not quite bronzeNose:Sweet fruits, yeast and grain, fresh and new sawdust, buttery toast, vaporous and wineyTaste:Caramel, a little Sherry flavour, fruity apples and oranges, a little green grape or watermelonFinish:Initially short and sweet which extends into a smooth and creamy finish with a little nutmeg.Would I buy it again:I’m not convinced by this expression, it seems a little like a single malt of three halves. The Macallan distillate is smooth and opulent as usual but gets a little lost in the almost blend-like qualities of the flavours going on in here and so can rapidly seem simple and not complex at all. Having said that for a basic level expression this is perfectly nice with subtle balanced flavours and is very easy and pleasing to drink. I think next time I’ll look for a Macallan with a bit more contrasting complexity to it…In conclusion another perfect beginners whisky perhaps – or one for dramming when you don’t want to think too hard about it.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Macallan Tagged as: 69 points, Alcohol by volume, Barrel, Macallan, Macallan Distillery, Macallan Fine Oak, Macallan Whisky, NAS, Oak, OB, Scotland, Single Malt - Macallan, Single malt whisky, The Macallan Fine Oak Triple Cask Matured, Triple Cask Matured, Whisky ",null

Arbeg is revered around the world as the peatiest, smokiest, most complex whisky of them all. Yet it does not flaunt the peat; rather the peat gives way to the malt, the natural sweetness of which subtly intrudes, producing perfect balance. The unusual spirit still with its purifier, the only one of its kind on Islay, is what we believe contributes to this balance and complexity, making Ardbeg the malt to which all others aspire… truly the ultimate Islay malt.Ardbeg Uigeadail (pronounced Oog-a-dal), takes its name from the brooding, mysterious loch which provides the peat-laden water fro Ardbeg. This is a special vatting of different styles of Ardbeg, marrying together its traditional deep, smoky notes with the luscious, sweet, raisiny tomes of old ex-Sherry casks.Ardbeg Uigeadail is non chill-filtered at high strength which retains maximum flavour and gives more body and added depth. With water a little cloudiness may occur which is perfectly natural. Winner of World Whisky of the Year 2009 (Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible).Nose:Deep and rounded – chocolate caramels combine with dates and smooth sherry notes. Later, you find leather with linseed oil. Withe water, sweetness gives way to malted honeycomb, flowering currants and a well-fired fruit pudding.Taste:Sweet, chewy and oily with a silky mouthfeel. Initially sweey, revealing fruit cake and treacle. Then comes smoked, barbecued honey-roast food with a slight hint of olives.Finish:Again long, both sweet and dry with honey, treacle and a trace of lint.",":I bought this from World of Whiskies at Edinburgh Aiport for £48.99. Already a big fan of Ardbeg after buying the Corryvreckan and also dining out on their Alligator [sorry – trying to think of some snappy remark to follow this…]. There is oodles of peat in these but at a chewy, meaty, complex level – not the take your breath and tastebuds away instantly kind of level. You can really taste the mediterranean in this from the sherry influence, this is superbly married and balanced and I just love it and can’t get enough.Laser spray code L12 185 17:57 6ml 12006140Colour:Copper – quite light, in fact incredibly light considering the amount of sherry influence in this [I love a whisky that lulls you into a false sense of security with a light golden colour then a wallop of flavours]Nose:Sweet peat smoke and a hint of peanuts, I also get the linseed oil from the notesTaste:Warm raisin and sultana fruit cake, cinnamon and nutmeg, pepper spice then a hint of fiery charcoal, treacle toffee then subtle chocolate. This also reminds me of membrillo [quince paste] with a barbecued smoky quality on top – like on a good smoked cheese e.g. smoked Lammermuir.Finish:Extremely long prickly warmth with sweet and smoke in equal measures and lots of juicy fruit jams.Would I buy it again:Nom nom nom, here is a whisky to chew over. Oh yes! This is like Christmas mince pies and washing them down with a good Sherry [i.e. what we called Santa’s share in our house] by a smoky log fire. Every taste seems to either reveal something new or the flavours evolve in your mouth and draw out memories and reminiscence.

Chardonnay is a green-skinned grape used to make white wine, originating in the Burgundy and Chablis regions of France but now used all over. Chardonnay grapes are thought to have quite a neutral character in terms of wine flavouring, allowing the oak and terroir to impart maximal qualities to the final flavour of the wine. The fementation of Chardonnay grapes allows for either buttery (malic acid) or green apple (lactic acid) flavours depending on how the grapes are allowed to break down. Charring of the oak casks used allows the development of such flavours as caramel, cream, smoke, spice, coconut, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla. Chardonnay grapes are also heavily used in the Champagne region of France, and subsequently production of Champagne.

Nowhere else will you find a distillery that still grows its own barley, that still malts its own traditional floor maltings, that still has coppers to tend all the casks and a coppersmith to tend the stills.From this distillery comes The Balvenie Peated Cask characterised by sweet spice and smoke. Peated cask is crafted by maturing for 17 years in a traditional oak whisky barrel before transferring to either a heavily peated cask or  a new american oak cask for a final period of maturation. The two finished liquids are then introduced to one another in traditional oak marrying vessels. The result is beautifully sweet and spicy with layers of peaty smokiness.Tasting notes: Prominent smoke softens to reveal oaky, honey and vanilla. Cinnamon and nutmeg develop with time.

The name derives from Scottish Gaelic Cnoc an Dhu, meaning “Little Black Hill”. The village is home to a few other small houses and the larger Knockando House, and is surrounded by woods in which there are buzzards, Red Squirrel and Roe Deer. In 1904 the distillery was purchased by W & A Gilbey, a gin producer from London, becoming part of J&B / Grand Metropolitan in the 1960s and 1970s, and is now owned by multinational firm Diageo.Knockando was the first distillery in Scotland to be built with electric lighting. In 1905 it was linked directly to the Great North of Scotland Railway, which connected Grantown-on-Spey with the main towns of north-east Scotland. Cottages for distillery workers were built nearby, as well as a house for the Customs and Excise Officer. The distillery currently lies near the disused Tamdhu Station, very close to the beginning of the Speyside Way. The railway has long since been dismantled.",":Knockando is a stones throw from Cardhu – a Distillery I have had the pleasure to visit – up in the picturesque hills above the river Spey. This is their entry level expression distilled in 1997 and aged 12 years, likely solely in American bourbon oak casks going from the colour and flavours. I picked this up from E.Leclerc in St. Hilaire Du Harcouet when I had just started getting into whisky. I was particularly interested in this because 1, it is not commonly seen on the shelf in the UK 2, Not only an age statement but year of distillation declared on the bottle and 3, What a great name for a drink ‘No can do’ [this is up there with Cairn O’Mohr fruit wines] frankly on both cases I hope they do just what they say on the tin!Colour:GoldNose:Fruity and biscuity cereal malt with oaky notesTaste:This is like peach and apricot jam with vanilla custard and a sprinkling of cinnamon spiceFinish:Surprisingly quite long, fruity and pricklyWould I buy it again:I’d certainly try Knockando again, in fact I have my eye on their sherry cask 18 year old retailing at about €35 – so I may just have to pick one up next time I’m in France.

It is a malt for the discerning drinker ~ a complex aroma preceds a fruity spicy taste with a hint of salt.",":Bought this from Glenkinchie distillery as they had run out of Dailuaine & Mortlach one of the times I had visited. The main reason I opted for the Inchgower was the Oystercatcher on the label. Whilst Livingston, West Lothian is not too far from the sea, we are inundated with Oystercatchers every summer. Livingston is blessed with two things critical for the Oystercatchers environ; 1, plentiful grass verges and roundabouts upon which they can probe for worms [their main diet – not Oysters!], 2, numerous 1970’s-1980’s industrial estates that have sprawling low-rise buildings [as Livingston has no green belt and space is not an issue] upon whose shingle roofs the Oystercatchers find a an improved simile of their usual nesting habitat – only these don’t have land predators like the beach and are therefore safer for raising their chicks. As a result Livingston has become an extremely popular place for Oystercatchers who dot the grass verges in their mating pairs and can be heard flying overhead with their distinctive pee-wit calls. Thus the entire family is obsessed with these characterful birds. In our hallway alone we have around 4 or 5 pieces of art depicting Oystercatchers. So in truth my other half desperately wanted the bottle when it is empty – so I had to oblige.Heamatopus ostralegusColour:GoldNose:Bread dough, yeast, pastry and sugar sweetness with cooking apples – in essence apple pie or strudelTaste:Apples, warm gingerbread, earthy raisins, a little coconut and vanilla and cereal, like muesli with apple and cinnamonFinish:Smooth floral, sweet and savoury with a pinch of salt [not the full on sea spray like Old Pulteney or Talisker]Would I buy it again:This dram diminishes upon drinking, the aromas promises much and is really quite complex but the flavours are simpler and the finish simpler still. This is really a whisky for the nose and is fun to warm the glass in the hands and see how powerful and complex these get. Really easy drinker – I’m not sure if I feel this is distinctly better [to my tastes] than numerous of the other floral and complex speysiders. I would definitely be intrigued if I stumbled upon perhaps more interesting finishes or cask strength versions of this – though how likely that is from what is probably a distillery producing malt mostly for blending I don’t know.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Inchgower Tagged as: 14 Years Old, 68 points, Alcohol by volume, Diageo, Diageo Flora and Fauna Range, Flora and Fauna, Inchgower, Inchgower 14 Year Old, Inchgower 14 Year Old Flora and Fauna, OB, Speyside single malt scotch whisky ", £40

These casks, previously used to mature sherry in southern Spain, are some of the most precious and expensive in use for maturing single malts. Each year, Douglas Cruickshank, our Master Distiller travels to Spain and personally selects the casks which will  contribute so much to the maturation of Aberlour.During the 12 long years the whisky spends in the cask, the single malt develops a rich and complex taste, an exceptional balance and a beautiful ruby colour, giving birth to an exceptional whisky.We recommend that you add a dash of water to your dram of Aberlour in order to enjoy the full aromatic strength and complexity of Aberlour 12 Year Old.Colour:Amber gold with hints of rubyNose:Sweet and very well-balanced with notes of Sherry and spicePalate:Powerful and rich with aromas of honey, red apple, toffee and gingerbread.Finish:Remarkably long and warm with hints of cinnamon and ginger.",":As I was tasting the 11 year old white oak Aberlour I thought I’d  finish a little vertical tasting with the 12 year old.

I think I will cherish this one for now and look out for a similar cask maturation with a little more age. It is surprising how fruity the Aberlour distillate is as I had assumed much came from the sherry cask. This is a beautiful contrast to the 10 year old and a worthy part of my collection.

The 2013 expression has enjoyed a double maturation in bourbon and port wood casks to create an exceptional balance of our signature peat flavour with tangy citrus fruits and a floral finish. Like any friendship, each blend of Laphroaig Cairdeas is completely unique – something to be savoured with friends old and new. Laphroaig Cairdeas – friendship distilled.This is perhaps the most eagerly anticipated email by our ‘Friends’ from me for the whole year because it gives me great pleasure to announce that this year’s special ‘Friends’ bottling – Cairdeas – is now on sale in our online shop. Of course every year Cairdeas is different, but this year I believe it is truly special and very unique indeed.I’m sure you’ll understand when I say that we do sometimes like to keep a few secrets to ourselves! Well, I managed to get a style of barrel that we’ve never used before and one that I’d been hoping to for a long time: port barrels! I’ve always felt that the marriage of Laphroaig with these barrels would produce something very special and frankly I was not disappointed – the result is simply delicious!For the technically-minded among you: it’s been bottled at 51.3% ABV, is non-chill filtered and is an all natural colour. But to be professional, here are my official tasting notes:Nose: Stewed Rhubarb, Huge peat moving into vanilla ice cream and milk chocolate. Gentle cloves, minty and fresh… Cairdeas Port wood then becomes floral like summer roses, orange marmalade and finishes with a long, dry charcoal finish.Palate: A lovely mouth feel and a nice balance, Cairdeas port wood has an initial honey sweetness but becomes dry quickly then creamy and floral, it shows a heavy saltiness and a great liquorice root flavour that really lasts, it then develops into a long, heavy charcoal finish mixing with orange rind flavours that really linger on the palate.","Holy moley this is something else! I have long been a fan of Laphroaig’s extreme peat sensation whisky and the more I drink the more I am beginning to think there must be nicotine in these bottles! Usually the peat in these hurt in a nice kind of way. Somehow they have managed to harness this with the port wood finish such that you get a massive hit of fruits going on at the same time as the peat explosion. The flavours fight and kick and scream with each other before laying waste to your tastebuds. The effect is amazing – this bottle should come with a warning on the label. With a little water in it you could sit down and write a book about just how many flavours are going on inside this whisky. However I have attempted to distil my thoughts down into the following:My tasting notes:Appearance: Rose pink.Nose: Parma violets, creosote and dry roasted peanuts.Taste: Salt and sweet peanut brittle, raspberry jam and smooth sweet smoked (BBQ) marshmallows.Finish: Long lasting drying smoke then juicy fruits flavours.", £47

The Hive is named after the honeyed sweetness found on the palate of this whisky. Each of these blended malts represents one of the key Scotch malt regions. The Hive is for the Speyside region, Spice King for the Highlands and Peat Chimney for Islay. As with the rest of the Wemyss Malts range, these blended malt whiskies have been developed in conjunction with the Scotch expert and writer Charlie Maclean and are bottled at 40% ABV.To see what Charles Maclean has to say about it watch it here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42FhBzYfk5Q&feature=youtu.beTo mark the launch of The Hive, the 12 years old blended malt range has been repackaged into new premium gift tins, and the bottle labels have also been redesigned for this launch. The new packaging features bold and striking designs, with quirky details to denote each expression; all in all delivering excellent shelf standout. The Hive and the rest of the newly re-packaged 12 years old range will be available from August 2011 in Travel Retail, EU, Asian and Australasian markets.William Wemyss, Managing Director of Wemyss Malts, commented “We continue to strive to bring accessible whiskies to the market and are taking this opportunity to refresh our range of premium blended malts with an excellent new product called The Hive and striking new gift tins across the 12 years old range.”",": I bought a 5cl miniature of this for £6 from Villeneuve wines [http://www.villeneuvewines.com/] in Peebles, as I had been dying to try something from Wemyss malts for awhile and was intrigued with an all malt blended whisky.

Lastly I though it would be nice to celebrate Wemyss Malts recent membership into the Fife chamber of commerce.My initial reaction was ‘too sweet’ and too blended i.e. difficult to pick out individual tastes. However, after a few sips, more and more revealed itself and the initially cloying sweetness faded away. On the last sip it suddenly hit me – there is a minute hint of something peated in here, cleverly hidden under all the rest.Colour:Soft golden honeyNose:Sweet [ester] wood polish like carnauba wax, citrus blossom and honeysuckleTaste:Citrus notes like grapefruit and apple, sweet and cloying initially, round and full bodied eventually like rhubarb with custard.

The first impression is of butterscotch and shortbread with fresh herbal/grassy notes. Lemon curd and meringue are discovered in the background.

This gives a good indication of the properties of the new make spirit from Glen Moray as the maturation is likely quite short [obvious in the colour]. There is also a slight imbalance in that the nose is very pungent with distillate aromas but none translate into the taste.

We absolutely love this, it has just the right amount of sweetness, and just the right amount of maturity. Distilled on the 8th March 1991 and bottled in March 2011, this is a refill hoggie-matured Speyside whisky, with an outturn of 274 bottles. Non-chillfiltered, with no artificial colouring. Just pure, unadulterated deliciousness!Nose: Toasty and soft, with lots of sweet malt. Gentle oak, which offers up notes of cinnamon and vanilla.Palate: Rounded and thick, with vanilla to the fore. This is not unlike a kind of alcoholic custard in fact, with more than a suggestion of apple strudel and stewed rhubarb. In the glass it becomes quite woody, and almost vegetal, with a hint of chamomile tea with honey in it.Finish: Good length, tangy and spicy, with a little orange zest and some cocoa.Overall: Spicy and rich, leave it in the glass and it opens up beautifully. Really a very complex whisky indeed.",":Having blitzed my way through the standard Cragganmore 12 year old offering from Diageo I couldn’t wait to get my hands on something more. I had already tried the Distillers edition via a friend and knew how good that was. Then I came across this bottling from Master of Malt’s own range. This was my first purchase from a specialist online whisky retailer and I couldn’t resist the age, distillery and the fact it was cask strength all for under £50. Plus I got a couple of master of malt glasses free! Bottle number 214 of 283 [9 bottles went missing already?], glad I grabbed this as soon as I could as it was sold out very very quickly. Fantastic unadulterated cask strength from Cragganmore, no fancy finishing here just pure Cragganmore spirit in a bourbon hogshead for 20 years. Yum yum yum, pure and simple old speyside whisky.Colour:GoldNose:Like freshly painted oak wood, with a hint of malted barley. After water this opens out to peach jellyTaste:Complex marmalade and heather honey on toast, a hint of fireworks and a little peach. This turns to more apricot with water.Finish:Smooth and delicate with a slight bitter aftertaste like extremely dark chocolate or the skin off green peas. With water this becomes increasingly peppery and drying as the strong oak wood influences are releasedWould I buy it again:I would definitely buy more Cragganmore, even the 12 year old if that was all I could get my hands on. I would also re-purchase from Master of Malt own bottlings again [just last week I went for their latest 16 year old Inchmurrin – almost purely on their taste description]. So overall a great result.

The clan’s defining influence on the distillery is still evident to this day, with the iconic royal stag’s antlers – taken from the Mackenzie family crest – adorning each and every bottle of The Dalmore.Located on the northern shores of the Firth of Cromarty, deep in the spectacular Scottish Highlands, the distillery is perfectly placed to take advantage of a feast of natural resources: from the waters of Loch Morie, found high in the hills overlooking the distillery, to the golden barley of the rich coastal soils of the Black Isle.  Being sited at sea level is critically important. Enveloped by the salt air, the sea-facing traditional dunnage warehouses provide the ideal conditions for maturation.The Dalmore 15 year old spends twelve years maturing in American white oak ex-bourbon casks, then a three year finish in three different sherry woods – Amoroso, Apostoles and Matusalem oloroso. A robust, yet elegant spirit. Elegant and robust, this expression delivers a rich and aromatic taste experience.A rich and aromatic heart full of Orange marmalade, cinnamon and nutmeg with a mandarin, vanilla, crushed apple and ginger mouth-feel to tantalise your tongue and an abundant aftertaste of peppery spice and oak to reward the palate.",":I purchased this for about €35 on offer in the duty free shop at Schipol Airport, partly because of the value and partly because I hadn’t tried this highland single malt but knew it had a good reputation and this was a damn good deal.I have to admit up front that I am a huge sherry fan when it comes to whisky finishing.

The spirit has been distilled from peated barley but via the usual Tomatin methods, giving a subtle hint of peatiness throughout. Matured in virgin oak, bourbon and sherry casks, but with no age statement, however the youngest is reputedly at least around 8 years old. From tasting I would say that the virgin oak and sherry influences are either minor or very well balanced and controlled by the light peat and huge tropical citrus fruit flavours Tomatin is famous for. Although initially the peat is obvious and spicy it mellows on serial sipping revealing lovely cereal and more bourbon cask influenced flavours.Colour:Pale straw yellow gold.Nose:Sweet peanut and creosote [peat influenced flavours] with lemons and pear drops [esters and ketones] and honey, this really reminded me of something medicinal like honey and lemon cough syrup.Taste:Initially fruity with lemon and orange then spicy pepper from the peat, this matures into a slightly drying mouthfeel with an oily quality like butter melting in your mouth. Sipping further, the peat influences recede and allow flavours of butter shortbread biscuit with vanilla and hazelnut.Finish:Slightly drying with receding sweet peat smoke, then a little more lemon and citrus.

For some reason they decided to put this on offer for a couple of weeks at £24.99! I can only assume they had it on the shelf for a long time and nobody was buying and they wanted to get rid of it? I have to admit I hadn’t heard of Glentauchers or had any idea what they produced. Also G&M –  due to the box I couldn’t see this was bottled in 2010, only that it was distilled in 1991, so I thought at first this was the 16 year old which comes in an identical bottle: http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/glentauchers-1991-whisky/ Imagine my surprise when I got it home to find it had aged another 3 years! Anyway, Glentauchers has a typically interesting history like most speyside distilleries. Pretty much unheard of as most of its output went for blending, it has been owned by most major operators at one time or another, with the most recent transition being between Caledonian Malt Whisky Distillers (a subsidiary of Allied Distillers) to Pernod Ricard. Interestingly the Distillery was mothballed between 1985 and 1992, so I can only assume that the 1991 vintages that Gordon & MacPhail have released were produced as part of the routine turnover distillates to check all was still in order before production began again in earnest in 1992.This is an amazing example of an aged speyside whisky, likely matured in refill bourbon barrels [at a guess]. The age gives it a little dryness and oakiness to the finish that makes you want to go back and sip some more.

From Edradour – Scotland’s teeniest tiniest distillery, 4. It comes in its own cute little colour-coded crate, 5. It’s whisky!Interesting finishes are perhaps not everyone’s cup of whisky, however I really enjoy the interesting additions to the flavour, nose and colour. Underneath is the base Edradour spirit aged for 8 years then interred into a Burgundy wine cask for 3 years.  The Burgundy [or Borgogne] region in eastern  France  typically produces renowned dry red wines from pinot noir grapes. This gives the whisky huge forest fruit and musty oak flavours and stunning colour. I tend not to water my whisky unless I have to, in this case it is well worthwhile as there are huge amounts of more flavours going on that the alcohol overpowers.Colour:Blood orange RED!Nose:Oranges and cloves.Taste:Warm caramel with orange, lemon and grapefruit leading to red berry jam and musky oak.Finish:Light & long, slightly drying with ginger apple and cinnamon.Would I buy it again:Maybe not until I had tried all of the other finishes, but I would definitely buy from the Edradour straight from the cask series again [in fact I already have!]. The Burgundy finish is a big yes from me, think sherry finish but with distinction and terroir.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Edradour Tagged as: 11 years old, 2000 vintage, 85 points, Burgundy, Cask strength, Edradour, Edradour 11 year Old Straight From The Cask Burgundy Finish, Edradour Burgundy Finish, Edradour distillery, Highland single malt scotch whisky, OB, Whisky ",null

From the only distillery that still employs all the traditional crafts of malt whisky making. Matured in: Oloroso sherry butts which impart deep, rich fruit and subtle spiciness, first fill bourbon barrels which add subtle vanilla oak and layers of honey and refill bourbon barrels which bring delicate, sweet notes and smoothness. Each cask used to create this batch of The Balvenie was hand selected by The Balvenie Malt Master; David Stewart",":I purchased this from the supermarket on offer of around £6-£8 off RRP, mostly because I love The Balvenie Doublewood and wanted to try further expressions from The Balvenie distillery http://www.thebalvenie.com/. Also The Balvenie were the first brand I had registered with online and started using their ‘Warehouse 24’ site which allowed you to rate your whisky by colour, aroma, taste, etc. and score them. From here started my earliest attempts at making tasting notes, and also discovered the more social side of tasting whisky as I would canvass opinion of all around, quickly realising that my Fiance had a far superior nose than I had!More balanced than the Doublewood this expression reveals how a single malt marriage can achieve and surpass what blends set out to do. Unlike blends, which I usually find taste of everything and nothing all at once so you can’t quite pick out any individual flavour, this revels in the individual characters of each finish.Colour:Yellow gold with a hint of copper blush.Nose:Sweet, floral honey with a hint of toffee and vanilla.Taste:Sweet vanilla, honey and oak. Subtle fruitiness and cereal flavours creating a well rounded but smooth not complex taste.Finish:Vaporous, spicy and a little lingering warmth but not unpleasant slightly drying then mouth-wateringly tempts you into taking another sip.Would I buy it again:Possibly, it is not as memorable as the Doublewood which I would permanently have in my collection. This is interesting and very drinkable but I think this almost simplifies single malt to blended examples. This is really The Balvenie just showing off at how perfect their single malt can be, I think I like my malts flaws and all, that way I never forget their character.Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Balvenie Tagged as: 12 Years Old, 69 points, Balvenie, David Stewart, OB, Scotch whisky, Scotland, Single malt whisky, Speyside single malt scotch whisky, The Balvenie, The Balvenie 12 Year Old Signature, The Balvenie Distillery, The Balvenie Signature, The Balvenie Whisky ",null

This is one patient customer – biding its time for 14 years in American white oak before spending a final two years in ex-Amoroso Oloroso sherry casks for an unbelievably full-bodied finish. Christmas seems to come early with all sorts of treats –  dark chocolate, orange and honey. Its 16-year odyssey has provided countless flavours for you to explore. The name of this 16-year-old whisky says it all. It’s the dram of choice for the people of Jura. And just like any Diurach, each drop is brimming with character. With such a proud and passionate heritage behind this whisky, it comes as no surprise that the Diurach’s own symbol stamps every bottle with approval.",":Purchased because I had really enjoyed the Jura Superstition and the 10 year old  was very drinkable and at £10 off list price I couldn’t walk away from this bargain. This is nice, even very nice, but not as amazing as I was expecting it to be. This is a bit of a shame as it is a very uncomplicated drinkable dram, but at 16 years old I expected a little more hidden depth and complexity to it. Maybe it should be admired in its delicacy as not all drams should be a complete assault on the senses. This makes a good after-dinner / dessert whisky as it is pleasing and has many sweet flavours. Also good for whisky new-comers as it is hard not to enjoy and the flavours are well-balanced and don’t overwhelm.Colour:Gold bronze.Nose:Marmalade, toffee and honey.Taste:Orange and ginger marmalade, salted caramel.Finish:Smoky and oaky in equal measures.Would I buy it again:Possibly not, I love the other Jura expressions but I guess I need to seek something more complex or cask strength or the like, this is a little too safe for me. On this note I recently tried and instantly purchased their travel retail exclusive Turas Mara expression which seems to have a lot more going on inside.Score 72/100Don’t take my word for it:Scotch Noob’s reviewWhisky Informative’s reviewWhisky Reviewer’s commentsThoughts from The CasksTOModera’s Whisky Reviews Jura 16 Diurach’s OwnBloggers submit link to your reviewName(required)ReviewSubmit   Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Jura Tagged as: 16 years old, 72 points, Island single malt scotch whisky, Jura, Jura 16 Diurach's Own, Jura 16 Year Old, Jura distillery, OB ", £44.99 from Master of Malt

This welcoming taste embodies the approachable side of Islay. Bunnahabhain 12 year old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky is now being re-introduced as an unchill-filtered spirit. A move which inspired articles, and tales from whisky lovers and experts across the world. When we changed to unchill-filtered malts to allow their full character to come out, we wanted packaging that told this story. With this in mind a new smoked-oak glass that hints at our flavour has replaced the traditional emerald green of the 12 year old bottle. Additionally dual labelling now tells the tale of our overall sense of specialty, subtlety, confidence and luxury. A revised neck label has also been developed to display the product’s age. And because a good story deserves a good presentation, the bottle now sits in a quality gift carton containing a booklet with tales of the Bunnahabhain brand.",":I bought my first on offer from Sainsbury’s supermarket for around £26, the second bottle came via someone in the whisky retail industry for £20 – an offer I couldn’t refuse.Very enjoyable basic expression from the Bunnahabhain distillery. This is an Islay that is not like an Islay. Bunnahabhain are not unique in producing un-peated [or very very lightly peated] expressions from amongst the Islay distilleries, however it is fair to say they have a unique balance in that they are mostly non-peaty with a rare peated expression thrown in – so the opposite of most of the other distilleries. I find it fascinating to think what other Islay distillations would be like without the peat influence, though it should be borne in mind that peat influences may enter the whisky via both the water source used and the use of peat smoke to dry the malted barley. I have to admit Bunnahabhain do produce a damn good malt and I have met many many whisky drinkers who are big fans of this whisky to the point that it is their favourite.Colour:Copper goldNose:Toffee apple and mintTaste:Honey, ginger, apple and vanillaFinish:Dry salted caramel shortcakeWould I buy it again:Most definitely, in fact I already have.

Its dry, complex strength of character, with characteristic notes of sea-spray, is perfectly matched by the sweet accents of sun-dried grapes derived from the Pedro-Ximinez cask-wood in which this special edition has been doubly matured.","Purchased from World of whiskies at Edinburgh Airport, and toured round icy Oslo. My main reason for wanting this was due to the number of people who either recommended Lagavulin or had heard that Lagavulin was THE Islay malt to try. Similar to the Old Pulteney WK209 Good Hope this is also a sherry finish whisky, i.e. at some point this has been transferred into Pedro Ximinez sherry casks to take on some of their flavour.Lagavulin is one of the three Kildalton Distilleries in the south of Islay and sits comfortably in between Ardbeg and Laphroaig at the “Hollow by the Mill”, translated from the Gaelic lag a’mhuilin. Lagavulin is pronounced as La-ga-voolinLagavulin Distillery officially dates from 1816, though records show illicit distillation on the site as far back as 1742. Originally there were two distilleries operating on this site, the first established in 1816 believed to be named “Kildalton”, and the second in 1817 named Lagavulin. There were also other small distilleries on the same site, Malt Mill Distillery and Ardmore Distillery.By 1837 there was only the one distillery, “Lagavulin” occupied by Donald Johnston. The still house was rebuilt in 1962 and incorporated the stills of the Malt Mill Distillery and in 1996 a new mashtun was installed, and automated controls put in place. The visitor centre dates back to 1998 and was established in the buildings that once were the maltings and kiln of Malt Mill Distillery.Lagavulin Distillery on IslayLagavulin Single Malt Whisky is characterized by its strong peat flavour and iodine overtones. The iodine flavour tends to divide tasters into love it or hate it groups with no middle ground, and it may not be suitable for new Scotch drinkers. The standard Lagavulin single malt is 16 years old, though they have also released a 12 year old cask strength variety, as well as their Distiller’s edition, finished in Pedro-Ximenez casks. Phenol levels running at 40 p.p.m.Lagavulin is produced by White Horse Distillers which is owned by United Distillers & Vinters which in turn is owned by Diageo plc. Lagavulin was chosen to represent Islay Single Malts in UDV’s Classic Malts of Scotland.Tasting notes:Colour: Red Gold.Nose: Sweet peanut, creosote, toffee and peach.Taste: Light and smooth in the mouth this is a very fruity whisky with raisins, morello cherries, honey and cloves which compliments the massive peat smoke flavour.Finish: Long and smoky with a hint of sweet candied peel that lingers.Would I buy it again:Yes! this is a perfect balance between the deep smoke Lagavulin and sweet sherry from the PX casks.  Although these are released yearly with some batch to batch variation, more recent versions have been met with as much good [and similar] reviews.Score 90/100Shop for Lagavulin Distillers Edition (Master of Malt)Shop for Lagavulin Distillers Edition (The Whisky Exchange)Rate this:Share this:TweetMoreEmailShare on TumblrPrintPocketLike this:Like Loading...Related Categories: Lagavulin Tagged as: 17 Years Old, 1994 vintage, 90 points, Diageo, Islay, Islay single malt scotch whisky, Lagavulin, Lagavulin 1994, Lagavulin Distiller's Edition, Lagavulin Distillery, OB, PX cask "," £70 for 1L,"

The barley was brought in by sea, the whisky shipped out by boat and many of the distillery workers were also employed as fishermen.During the 19th century, Wick became the capital of the ‘Herring Boom’, which saw the town transformed from a remote Highland village into “the greatest fishing station in the world”, with more than 1000 drifters harboured there. The fishing industry was dominated by the ‘Herring Drifter’ fishing boats, originally sail boats, with the first recorded steam drifter built in Wick in 1869. All boats from Wick are identified by the letters ‘WK’ in their registration. At the peak of the ‘Herring Boom’ steam drifters numbered more than 1,800, of which only two seaworthy examples remain intact today.The fishing industry is no longer part of the daily life in Wick but Pulteney Distillery, in the heart of the town, continues to operate using the same traditional distilling methods first introduced in the 1800’s to create an astonishingly complex single malt, with a rich, mineral-salted spiciness that is the very essence of this remarkable place.Good Hope WK209Built in Wick in 1948 and powered by a Gardner 152hp engine she was 55 feet in length and weighed in at 24 tons. The Good Hope was the first boat in Wick to install an echo sounder, using radio navigation to find the ever elusive shoals of herring.Released for general sale on 8th March 2011.
